"01-24-2016";" 02:44 AM";"Hi John! You bring up the $64 Million Question facing the High Risk Post RP Community?!?!

Your specific answer will come from your expert MDs at UC. At your 12 week appointment with your surgeon you will have 2 PSA results. You will likely also have a consult with a UC RO around the same time.

The prevalent thinking is that earlier AR/SR with higher risk categories has better long term results.

My URO surgeon in AL, told me at 6 months that I might need SR if my PSA began to rise. At post OP month 7, I went to Emory Univ / Atlanta to investigate a new SR research study protocol. I got worked up with 3 meetings with the RO (who specializes in PC) a bone scan and an MRI.

The RO told me that I was in a higher risk category and according to current data I should consider SR. I told him that I did not want radiation unless / until there was a definitive rising PSA. He agreed with me that continued vigilant monitoring of my PSA was advisable.

I questioned the 'validity' of the results of the early AR/SR data. There is a BIG UNKNOWN in the data that can never be measured or answered = Of all of the patients with successful outcomes following early AR/SR, how many would have never had recurrent PC without AR/SR????. No one knows!!! But there is likely a significant # who never needed radiation.

Thus in my case ( Positive Margin, EPE's, Tertiary Pattern 5 ) I met with my home town primary urologist and we decided to monitor my PSA like a Hawk and hold off SR unless there is a definitive clinical rising PSA. In addition, if I went through SR and later in life developed a different unrelated CA in the abdominal region, then radiation could never again be a treatment option. At best, I wanted to buy as much time as possible to fully heal & regain lost functions and hope that newer treatments would come available.

Genomic testing is already generating ways to determine which PCs will likely progress / recur. I have no doubt that the predictive accuracy of these tests will exceed 90% in the next few years.

Lastly, I'm an advocate of uPSA testing for post RP men with high risk surgical/pathology findings. A definitive rising PSA requires 2-3 consecutive rises. Going from 0.01 to 0.03 does NOT in any way define or indicate a rising PSA! This is the Big problem with uPSA causing a lot of unnecessary angst & anxiety. Time is also a factor. If one measures their PSA every 3 months, it takes 6 months to get 3 readings. If your MD is set on AR, you may not have 6 months to get 3 measurements.

For now simply try and relax. Be thankful that you took it upon yourself to go to UC to have your surgery. Your RP is now behind you and you are healing. Your 12 week post op meeting with your URO surgeon will be enlightening. There remains the possibility that you are cured. Your surgeon may agree to close monitoring of your PSA and hold of AR/SR until there is a clinical rise.

Ultimately, your MDs' expert clinical judgement will provide the best guidance. If in fact you are not already cured, then complete cure via RT remains highly likely!

Stay optimistic!!!

"01-24-2016";" 08:48 PM";"Hi John! Apologies for any confusion. Keep in mind that the 1st PSA in a series represents time point ""0."" So if monitoring one's PSA every 3 months, the 3rd PSA measurement is taken 6 months following the 1st.

If monitoring your PSA turns out to be an option supported by your surgeon, be sure to discuss if he advocates ""uPSA"" & the frequency to have your PSAs measured. Every 3 months seems to be a general standard time interval. I'm sure shorter intervals are acceptable but will be more difficult to detect a slowly rising PSA.

Take a look at Jim215's Signature. His post RP PSA record charts a perfectly straight line slowly rising PSA! His intervals were 6 months. It took 18 months to get 3 consecutive rises suggesting imminent BR. Jim wisely initiated SR before reaching the AUA definitive standard of 0.2

May your PSA never rise!

Good luck!

MM16,

Looks like you are familiar with the JH study on survival benefit from early intervention when PSA was detectable around 0.03 instead of the normal 0.2. My comments here is that you do not need another 6 months to confirm BCR after one detectable 0.03 PSA reading. You could start a retest in another month, then another month to confirm so you only spend two more months before pulling the SRT trigger.

What you are struggling with is whether you should take any action NOW instead of wait it out. You want to know if there is any advantage in jumping the gun and do ART in your case.

Your specific answer will come from your expert MDs at UC. At your 12 week appointment with your surgeon you will have 2 PSA results. You will likely also have a consult with a UC RO around the same time.

The prevalent thinking is that earlier AR/SR with higher risk categories has better long term results.

My URO surgeon in AL, told me at 6 months that I might need SR if my PSA began to rise. At post OP month 7, I went to Emory Univ / Atlanta to investigate a new SR research study protocol. I got worked up with 3 meetings with the RO (who specializes in PC) a bone scan and an MRI.

The RO told me that I was in a higher risk category and according to current data I should consider SR. I told him that I did not want radiation unless / until there was a definitive rising PSA. He agreed with me that continued vigilant monitoring of my PSA was advisable.

I questioned the 'validity' of the results of the early AR/SR data. There is a BIG UNKNOWN in the data that can never be measured or answered = Of all of the patients with successful outcomes following early AR/SR, how many would have never had recurrent PC without AR/SR????. No one knows!!! But there is likely a significant # who never needed radiation.

Thus in my case ( Positive Margin, EPE's, Tertiary Pattern 5 ) I met with my home town primary urologist and we decided to monitor my PSA like a Hawk and hold off SR unless there is a definitive clinical rising PSA. In addition, if I went through SR and later in life developed a different unrelated CA in the abdominal region, then radiation could never again be a treatment option. At best, I wanted to buy as much time as possible to fully heal & regain lost functions and hope that newer treatments would come available.

Genomic testing is already generating ways to determine which PCs will likely progress / recur. I have no doubt that the predictive accuracy of these tests will exceed 90% in the next few years.

Lastly, I'm an advocate of uPSA testing for post RP men with high risk surgical/pathology findings. A definitive rising PSA requires 2-3 consecutive rises. Going from 0.01 to 003 does NOT in any way define or indicate a rising PSA! This is the Big problem with uPSA causing a lot of unnecessary angst & anxiety. Time is also a factor. If one measures their PSA every 3 months, it takes 6 months to get 3 readings. If your MD is set on AR, you may not have 6 months to get 3 measurements.

For now simply try and relax. Be thankful that you took it upon yourself to go to UC to have your surgery. Your RP is now behind you and you are healing. Your 12 week post op meeting with your URO surgeon will be enlightening. There remains the possibility that you are cured. Your surgeon may agree to close monitoring of your PSA and hold of AR/SR until there is a clinical rise.

Ultimately, your MDs' expert clinical judgement will provide the best guidance. If in fact you are not already cured, then complete cure via RT remains highly likely!

Here is a summary of your pathology report:

Final Pathology Report; Jan. 6 2016

15 lymph nodes; no tumor present
gleason upgraded to 9 ( 4+5)
EPE; present
Lymphovascular invasion present
Right SV Positive
Left SV and vasa deferentia, no tumor present
PIN
Perineural invasion present
Tumor location: Preipheral zone right; and left transition zone
Tumor volume est 45%
2 positive margins of 4 ( Peripheral and distal)
Staging: pT3bNO
Please pardon my straight talk. I had a chance to review your post op pathology report summary and in my layperson opinion you have a very aggressive cancer which had escaped the capsule and invaded adjacent organs. I am especially worry about the ""Lymphovascular invasion present"". It said the cancer had invaded the lymphatic systems. So, the chance of BCR is high. I am sure you are struggling to figure out what to do.

IMHO, first order of business, if you have not already done so is to consult a radiation oncologist and an oncologist. Your surgeon's job is done, you really do not need him going forward. I also suggest you get a second read of your specimen from a second pathologist. If I were you, what I like to know is also the type of prostate cancer I have, is it the ""garden verity"" adenocarcinoma or some rarer type. If in the unlikely case you have a rare type, I would throw everything including the kitchen sink at it.

I am doing all of the above to assess the odds of my cancer staying local and not go systemic. I would be aggressive if my odds of local is low so I do not lose any more precious time. In treating cancer, there is a rule I considered canonical: Early detection and early treatment trump everything even for hard to treat cancers. Take your case, if your cancer is still local, hormone+Rt will take care of it and you will be cure. If not, hormone+RT won't cure you. But you really do not know. This much I know for sure: Everyday you wait there is one more day to allow the cancer cells to go systemic if it is still local. So your chance for a cure diminishes for every day you wait.

I also would like to know my post op side effects, especially continence. If I am continent from the get go, or almost dry right now, it gives me great flexibility in plotting my next move. I would probably wait for my first PSA test before doing anything but I want my PSA test at 6 weeks instead of the traditional 3 months. If PSA is detectable, I have no choice but go with hormone+SRT as soon as can be arranged. If PSA is non detectable, I do the following analysis:

I would construct a ""decision tree"" starting from:

1. My health and my age. If I were young and healthy, I would be more aggressive about followup treatment and may choose ART depending on #2. If my health is not good and life expectancy is <10 yrs, I may choose managing my cancer instead of shooting for a cure. This is a QOL issue and is a personal choice not a medical choice.

2. My side effects. If continence is good, I would be more aggressive and may go with hormone+ART right away, if not I might wait a few months until continence improves since continence recovery may be impeded by RT. If I choose hormone+RT, a few months of hormone may be enough to let continence take care of itself but not affecting RT outcome.

3. If I am more worry about QOL (e.g. continence, etc.) instead of aggressive cancer cure, I could choose to wait it our and monitoring my PSA carefully. If and as soon as PSA becomes detectable per the JH guideline, I would start hormone+SRT.

I am not in any way involved in healthcare and is just a layperson, so this is non professional opinion.

Take care.";"Last edited by newporter; 01-25-2016 at 05:40 AM.

"01-24-2016";" 08:48 PM";"Hi John! Apologies for any confusion. Keep in mind that the 1st PSA in a series represents time point ""0."" So if monitoring one's PSA every 3 months, the 3rd PSA measurement is taken 6 months following the 1st.

If monitoring your PSA turns out to be an option supported by your surgeon, be sure to discuss if he advocates ""uPSA"" & the frequency to have your PSAs measured. Every 3 months seems to be a general standard time interval. I'm sure shorter intervals are acceptable but will be more difficult to detect a slowly rising PSA.

Take a look at Jim215's Signature. His post RP PSA record charts a perfectly straight line slowly rising PSA! His intervals were 6 months. It took 18 months to get 3 consecutive rises suggesting imminent BR. Jim wisely initiated SR before reaching the AUA definitive standard of 0.2

May your PSA never rise!

Good luck!

Here is a summary of your pathology report:

Final Pathology Report; Jan. 6 2016

15 lymph nodes; no tumor present
gleason upgraded to 9 ( 4+5)
EPE; present
Lymphovascular invasion present
Right SV Positive
Left SV and vasa deferentia, no tumor present
PIN
Perineural invasion present
Tumor location: Preipheral zone right; and left transition zone
Tumor volume est 45%
2 positive margins of 4 ( Peripheral and distal)
Staging: pT3bNO
Please pardon my straight talk. I had a chance to review your post op pathology report summary and in my layperson opinion you have a very aggressive cancer which had escaped the capsule and invaded adjacent organs. I am especially worry about the ""Lymphovascular invasion present"". It said the cancer had invaded the lymphatic systems. So, the chance of BCR is high. I am sure you are struggling to figure out what to do.

IMHO, first order of business, if you have not already done so is to consult a radiation oncologist and an oncologist. Your surgeon's job is done, you really do not need him going forward. I also suggest you get a second read of your specimen from a second pathologist. If I were you, what I like to know is also the type of prostate cancer I have, is it the ""garden verity"" adenocarcinoma or some rarer type. If in the unlikely case you have a rare type, I would throw everything including the kitchen sink at it.

I am doing all of the above to assess the odds of my cancer staying local and not go systemic. I would be aggressive if my odds of local is low so I do not lose any more precious time. In treating cancer, there is a rule I considered canonical: Early detection and early treatment trump everything even for hard to treat cancers. Take your case, if your cancer is still local, hormone+Rt will take care of it and you will be cure. If not, hormone+RT won't cure you. But you really do not know. This much I know for sure: Everyday you wait there is one more day to allow the cancer cells to go systemic if it is still local. So your chance for a cure diminishes for every day you wait.

I also would like to know my post op side effects, especially continence. If I am continent from the get go, or almost dry right now, it gives me great flexibility in plotting my next move. I would probably wait for my first PSA test before doing anything but I want my PSA test at 6 weeks instead of the traditional 3 months. If PSA is detectable, I have no choice but go with hormone+SRT as soon as can be arranged. If PSA is non detectable, I do the following analysis:

I would construct a ""decision tree"" starting from:

1. My health and my age. If I were young and healthy, I would be more aggressive about followup treatment and may choose ART depending on #2. If my health is not good and life expectancy is <10 yrs, I may choose managing my cancer instead of shooting for a cure. This is a QOL issue and is a personal choice not a medical choice.

2. My side effects. If continence is good, I would be more aggressive and may go with hormone+ART right away, if not I might wait a few months until continence improves since continence recovery may be impeded by RT. If I choose hormone+RT, a few months of hormone may be enough to let continence take care of itself but not affecting RT outcome.

3. If I am more worry about QOL (e.g. continence, etc.) instead of aggressive cancer cure, I could choose to wait it our and monitoring my PSA carefully. If and as soon as PSA becomes detectable per the JH guideline, I would start hormone+SRT.

I am not in any way involved in healthcare and is just a layperson, so this is non professional opinion.

Take care.";"Last edited by newporter; 01-25-2016 at 05:40 AM.

Yes, a number of recent studies have positive results using nanoparticle as vector to deliver chemo more effectively and directly to cancer cells and avoid the ""chemo damage"" to good cells that Sequoiaranger was talking about. One such nano carrier is BIND-014 which is entering clinical trial.

Sequoiaranger, you started Taxotere in April. Is everything OK? Perhaps you should ask your doctor about BIND-014 or something similar just in case Taxotere stops working for you?

Everything is OK, so far. Had my 7th infusion two days ago, and am entering the week-long ""Neulasta Netherworld"" of flu-like symptoms and general malaise. My ""plan"" is for three more (total, 10) infusions. My PSA had been dropping precipitously each infusion until the last one, where rather than a 30% drop or so, it was only 6%. Might just be a ""bauble"", might indicate the point of diminishing return. I have inquired into a ""local"" BIND-014 trial. They have openings RIGHT NOW, but I am temporarily ineligible (being under treatment). So I am sticking to my current regimen for at least one more PSA test. The BIND-014 system does use Taxotere, but of course rather than ""broadcast"" the drug throughout the body, cancer cells are targeted.

I fully realize that cancer, especially at Gleason 9, is a CHRONIC disease, but I am getting really tired of being under a constant state of ""emergency"" trying to stifle expansive growth. Comparatively, it was so nice to be merely on Lupron when it was keeping my monster quiescent.";"Last edited by sequoiaranger; 08-19-2012 at 03:46 PM.

"08-19-2012";" 08:38 PM";"sequoiaranger, that's the source of the article -- it's in the Journal ""Nature Medicine,"" which is a very reputable medical journal. But all you can see online is the abstract. If you want to read the whole article, you can probably get it through interlibrary loan from your local library, or you can just stop at your hospital's library and run off a copy of it there.

Keep in mind this is a laboratory test in which they deliberately damaged fibroblasts to measure the effect. The abstract doesn't tell us what type of chemo they used, and they don't tell us whether the concentration of the chemo was similar to what our bodies experience. In the lab they exaggerate conditions so they can see a clear effect. When I do chemo out here in the real world my doctor and nurses constantly remind me to stay hydrated to minimize the effect of the chemo on my normal cells. They remind me to avoid injury, too. Fibroblasts are active when your body needs to heal an injury.

I think this is an interesting thing and it might help them develop a new approach to treating chemo-resistant cancers, but I really think it makes no difference to me at all as a current patient.

CancerForum's parent company, Internet Brands, also owns the website Urologists.org, and the content team there has asked if we could help them with a special project.

Since the members and moderators here on CancerForums are so well educated, it would be extremely helpful to the editors at Urologists.org to get some insight and tips, ideas, etc., from those with experience.

If you feel like helping out, please comment on this thread with any insight, ""I wish I'd known...,"" advice, etc.--anything you think would help the Urologist.org editor to create a good, comprehensive piece.

1. uses a small number of beams that cover a large area
2. treatment can last up to 40 days
position has to be rigid
3. small parts of the body surrounded by important tissues may not be reached by regular radiation beams

Radiosurgery
1. uses a large number of beams that cover a small area
2. using many beams and a smaller area of treatment mean that the tissues around the tumour get less radiation
treatment can be completed in one to 10 days
3. position is less rigid because the robot can correct for changes in tumour position

If I would have had the option at the time, I would have chosen radiosurgery. My understanding of the difference between the cyberknife and conventional radiation is the precision of the cyberknife allows for fewer, more precise treatment. This info was found at

Re: ""My initial reaction? Quality of life. I can understand wanting to go after it relatively early, but get a sense of the PSADT maybe see how long it can be controlled with intermittent hormone therapy and hit it at perhaps 5.0, not 0.1.""

The ASTRO review that you directed us to read states:

1) ""developed elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels from 0.2 to 4.0 ng/ml"" So if considering 2 yrs of HT, it may be better to start well before your PSA reaches 5.0

2) ""the study results showed that the actuarial OS at 10 years was 82 percent for the RT plus AAT patients and 78 percent for the RT plus placebo patients"" The question becomes: Is 2 years of HT worth a 4% increase in OS (Overall Survival)?

3) At 12 years, both the incidence of PC related deaths and metastatses were significantly lower in the RT + AAT group.

Thus, your Quality of Life question is important and must be weighed against the benefits that 2 years of AAT appears to offer. That's where the input of a highly experienced MO who specializes in treating PC will be most important.

I remain confident that new and novel treatment modalities will emerge in the next few years. By decreasing the risk of metastasis and keeping recurrent PC in check may well provide the opportunity for a new treatment to work.

Best wishes for taking the optimal course of action that works best for you.

I hope your treatment will be successful so you do not have to face this dilemma.

Since it is hypothetical, let me give you a hypothetical answer based on logic:

I assumed there are a lot of similarities between different types of cancer, especially between breast cancer and prostate cancer. I am not arguing about non aggressive prostate cancer where AS seemed to be fine. I am talking about prostate cancer that are aggressive, so similar to typical breast cancers. Here are a few recent researches on delaying treatment and delaying chemo for breast cancer:

http://www.mdanderson.org/newsroom/n...-negative.html

http://archsurg.jamanetwork.com/arti...icleid=1681805

http://journal.frontiersin.org/artic...014.00087/full

It essentially said delaying treatment and chemo reduced survival.

I often stayed up at night think about ""what if's"". My conclusion, for me anyway was to throw everything at it as early as possible and with as many modalities as my body could take because a., multiple modalities reduced the chance of mutation and b., earlier gets the cancer before drug resistance or distant met. As for QOL, being cancer free >> on hormone for the rest of my life, even if I have to endure up six months of chemo and two years of hormone.

I don't know if the logic makes any sense but as you said it is hypothetical.

These are legitimate topics to talk over with your oncologists to see what their views are so in case you have to pull the trigger you have a plan.

Regards,
A fair and reasonable response. On the other hand, if IHT could control the cancer and keep it 5.0 or lower for five, eight, ten years....is there enough advantage and evidence in terms of earlier intervention with chemo and complete hormone block that it's worth that?

And would it be useful to perhaps establish a PSA doubling rate by tracking it after recurrence to determine just how agressive it might be?

As I have mentioned previously, I am being bombarded with recommendations that span the gambit. I have PCa, 4/12 cores positive, 10% PTI (small volume), Gleason score for 3, 3+3 and the forth 3+4. Initially, urologist recommended DaVinci surgery and made arrangements for me to see a surgeon and RO. Surgeon thought cancer was too early stage to risk complications (at time, Nov 2014) and sent me back to RO. Wife, a devout Christian, believes trusting in man instead of God is anti-biblical and would doom me. She insists on natural medicine and prayer. As compromise, she agreed to accompany me to Dana Faber Cancer Institute in Boston given world-class status of DF. I live approx 45 miles outside of Boston so visit was one of convenience.

RO at DF ordered a MRI guided coil biopsy and conducted a pathological consult of previously collected 12 cores. Results were EXACTLY the same with respect to 4 positive, % PTI, and Gleason. However, MRI did NOT show ANY well defined tumors only area with positive cores ""hyper enhanced"" as well as a second area suggesting microscopic cancer cell clusters developing there. RO was so ecstatic over results I though she was going to arrange for a ticker tape parade! That was all my Jesus-touting wife needed to hear so now I am ""cured"". RO recommended AS with PSAs checked every 4-6 months and biopsy every year. This recommendation was totally inconsistent with EVERYTHING I have read, as well as inconsistent with the sound advice I received from all of you who responded to my earlier posts, AND my urologist who thinks 4/12 cores suggest cancer already progressing as well as my age, 62, being a bit too young for AS. Suggests the risk too high and need, at minimum, radiation.

So, wanted to advise that there is a now another option available for all us PCa sufferers and that is Inactive Surveillance which is where I am now. Total limbo and I haven't a clue where to go from here. No matter which option I choose, I will face criticism for doing more than was needed or doing nothing at all. I sure hope all you good people never have to face a life-altering delemma like this as we have plenty else to deal with once we get that dreaded diagnosis! I will post again at a later date.

"04-27-2015";" 05:21 PM";"Good luck to you, Wayne. I'm sorry for the situation you continue to deal with, including the one presented by your wife. That has to really be tough.

The general (and they are just guidelines) rules of thumb to qualify for Active Surveillance are:
* no more than 2 positive cores
* no positive core more than 50% involvement
* Gleason score no higher than 6
* PSA not in double figures

The main thing is that you have twice as many positive cores as recommended for AS. I've read posts from men who, themselves, insisted on doing nothing but AS because of a supposedly low Gleason score. One man had a sudden spike in his PSA and ended up having surgery. The post-op pathology revealed (if I recall properly) there was a Gleason 9 in there that had never been detected by previous testing.

He now faces a real uphill battle.

So it is a roll of the dice to go on AS with four positive cores. Can you give us your current and previous PSA readings? While the PSA is not a definitive indicator of Gleason scores, usually the lower PSA numbers are not associated with highly aggressive tumors. But, if I recall, the reference up above also involved a lower Gleason score.

I would consider going to a super-iconic facility such as Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, etc., and get their opinion on whether AS is truly warranted in your particular case. And I would not worry what others have to say. I would basically reply to them, ""how dare you criticize a potentially disease that is victimizing someone else and not yourself?"" In other words, they can offer their thoughts, but it is SOLELY YOUR OWN decision to make since the potential downside is your own personal health issue.

Hang in there and remember we're all here for you.

I'm on the somewhat opposite end of the spectrum--I'm procrastinating over surgery, and my wife is pestering the crap out of me about scheduling it! Are your 4 cores uni or bi-lateral (on 1 or both sides of the prostate)? Some AS programs take this into consideration.

While I'm not a particularly religious man, I've generally held the belief that God helps those that help themselves. I'd say if you're a ""believer"" then those people in the clean white coats, as well as all of that fancy equipment, are a product of God and are here at His will to help us--and you!

Kind of like the joke:
There was a preacher who fell in the ocean and he couldn't swim. When a boat came by, the captain yelled, ""Do you need help, sir?"" The preacher calmly said ""No, God will save me."" A little later, another boat came by and a fisherman asked, ""Hey, do you need help?"" The preacher replied again, ""No God will save me."" Eventually the preacher drowned & went to heaven. The preacher asked God, ""Why didn't you save me?"" God replied, ""Fool, I sent you two boats!""

I'm not going to criticize another guy's wife, but her line of thinking, frankly, astounds me. I just watched my stepfather die of this disease after a 6 year battle. It wasn't pretty. I had an aunt with breast cancer that refused most medical treatment and relied on""holistic"" methods. She didn't make it past 49 years old. Personally, I think you have to get some kind of treatment, whether surgery or radiation. Also personally, I don't think that I can live comfortably knowing it's still inside of me, so I'm likely going the surgery route.

I would say that most here are more conservative regarding doing AS. Much more inclination to do treatment, just to be safer.
Some of that may be tilted by a reinforcement of a choice they've already made.
I would say this, a high percentage of those who do AS and then eventually do a treatment, come out just as positively as though they had done initial treatment.

You said your wife is a devout Christian and believes trusting in man instead of God is anti-biblical and would doom you. She insists on natural medicine and prayer.

Forgive me, but seeking treatment and making intelligent, informed decisions is NOT anti-biblical and is not dishonoring God. How is seeking treatment trusting in man and not God? You can still seek treatment, find the best medical provider you can trust and trust the results to God and pray for a positive outcome and strength for your ordeal.

I am a Christian wife and I don't believe there is anything wrong with seeking treatment. God gave us highly-skilled medical professionals and it is our responsibility to use their gifts to help us.

The best thing your wife can do for you is help you make good, informed decisions that have YOUR best interest in mind. There will be good days and bad days during your recovery, but together you can get through them and she can do alot to help you recover. As a believer, she should know that God does not always bring a healing, but can use your experience to help others, make you stronger, or for other purposes you may not now discern. I am not discrediting healing, but your wife cannot presume that is what will happen in all cases.

Maybe you could have another PSA test in the very near future for your wife's peace of mind before making a decision about how to proceed.

Yes, there are risks with any treatment, but doing nothing also carries risk. I think your outlook can help with dealing with whatever you may face, and no two people are the same. My husband had surgery almost 5 weeks ago. He is not really having any ED issues, but is still dealing with some incontinence and challenges with changing and variable urinary frequency/urgency and stream, but it has not been anything horrible. Mainly, we just want to be sure we know if he has issues that require medical attention. He can still go to work in his office and no one knows he wears a pad. One will usually last all day. He is looking forward to the day he doesn't need them.

The most important thing you need right now is your wife's support. I hope she will accept your decision and not brow beat or guilt you over whatever you choose. You ultimately have to make the decision that you feel is best for you. Once you make your decision and move ahead, don't look back and second guess. If you carefully plan and analyze all options, you should be comfortable with your choice.

Good luck!";"";"Jphil";"http://www.cancerforums.net/members/114280-Jphil";"";"Experienced User";"Mar 2015";"Not Found";"19"

Chuck's suggestion about Hopkins or Mayo for an opinion is solid. However, if you don't want to go out of state, were I in your situation, I would make an appointment for an opinion with Marc Garnick, MD. He is the medical prostate and testicular CA ""guru"" at DF. His clinical practice office may be at BI-D. Simply Google him.

Keep in mind, not all Gleason (3+3) and Gleason (3+4) adenocarcinomas progress to the point of requiring intervention. That is the ""Big Conundrum"" There are likely tens of thousands of males walking around with PC and never know it and may live a full life without ever knowing!

If long term AS is discussed, I would want to know the # of biopsy procedures projected in the next 5 years. Some contributors to this forum have undergone 5 or more series of biopsies! If you add up the total costs of the biopsies and the histologies, prostatectomy may not cost much more!

Fortunately, the DF MRI will serve you well as a baseline to detect any future changes or progressions.

For ""ease of mind"" seek another opinion from a true expert.

If AS is the recommendation, then relax, have fun and enjoy life! If so, I hope you will be monitored by MRI only!

Lifestyle modifications are very integral to your overall health and well being - including prostate health. Healthy dietary modifications and exercise regimens are essential. Add a dose of Divine Intervention and all will be well!

Assuming you are a baseball fan, I remember what Steve Garvey said when he announced that he had PC: ""I was thrown a pretty good curveball by God!""

In your case, if the same curve ball is thrown, you'll knock it over the Green Monster!

I was wired for AS, but the decision was taken out of my hands as I had G4. Even though it was a single core with G3+4, it put me out of the standard (and my) threshold for AS.

One Dr suggested I have a second opinion in case it was downgraded to a G3+3. I decided against it, as in my mind someone saw something which rated as a G4. For me to go on AS, I would have needed two different doctors both rating my core as a G3+3.

Turns out after surgery I was a G4+3 and my surgeon and GP use me as a textbook case to seek active treatment if there's anything beyond a G3 living in a prostate.

IF you decide to go on AS, then I suggest you get every test you can which are listed in the AS sticky and have a strict ""threshold"" to get off AS and seek active treatment (most of us would argue that you are already past that threshold). Have a mri-guided saturation biopsy to be 100% sure nothing is ""hiding"" in there. Have your PSA tested every three months.

Excellent post, dday,

A great example of what I'm trying to say about ""rolling the dice"" with AS.
Please keep in mind that some people are willing to ""roll the dice"". Nothing wrong with making that choice, taking some risk.

In fact, many men live rolling the dice every day for other parts of their health, yet somehow put prostate cancer into some other category. Perhaps because its the C word.
The truth is that a good percentage of men over age 50 live every day, month, and year, with a much much greater chance of death...even instant death... from heart disease and sudden cardiac arrest. Their lifestyle puts them at considerable risk but they seldom treat it with the same extensive care and consideration they assign to their 3+3 or 3+4 prostate cancer biopsy.

So in fact, knowingly, or unknowingly, huge numbers of men are ""rolling the dice"" all the time. Including many of those who are not inclined to take any chances with AS...thinking it too risky.
I don't think it inappropriate to mix the two types of ""rolling the dice""

This doesn't mean that because someone ignores their heart attack risk, that they should also ignore their prostate cancer risk.
I'm only pointing out a incongruity in the way so many seem to assign risk.. or avoid risk.

Interestingly many of the steps to mitigate heart risk are also thought to lessen prostate cancer risks, even for those who have already undergone treatment.";"";"Otago";"http://www.cancerforums.net/members/10792-Otago";"";"Top User";"Jan 2008";"Not Found";"639"

A suggestion would be to add another, recent type of testing to your case. The genomics tests by OncotypeDX and by Prolaris, will provide further risk assessment that can influence your decision, or give you some confidence.

I worked in a law enforcement capacity for the federal govt for 26 yrs. As such, I was obligated to go for a govt-paid physical once per year in order to remain in an enforcement position. The physical included a DRE in which I was so vehemently opposed to having that Uncle Sam agreed to conduct prostate screening for me by paying (extra mind you) for a PSA blood test. After about 10 yrs, the govt Drs noticed a gradual increase in PSAs fron low 1's to mid-3's. After I retired in 2008, my urologist continued to perform PSA screening which remained in the 3's until starting to rise over last couple of years. In early Nov, 2014 my PSA was at 5.1...mildly elevated...and my urologist decided to retest and include a % free PSA screen with the next blood draw. These results were a concern as my PSAs rose only slightly to 5.3 but % free PSA came back at only 8%. He explained that free PSAs under 25% bear watching closely and anything less than 10% requires some additional action. So, despite my refusal to undergo DRE testing for years working for Uncle Sam (which ironically may have saved my life!) I agreed to a prostate biopsy. The results are what brings me to this forum. Again, thanks for your input Chuck.

The general (and they are just guidelines) rules of thumb to qualify for Active Surveillance are:
* no more than 2 positive cores
* no positive core more than 50% involvement
* Gleason score no higher than 6
* PSA not in double figures

The main thing is that you have twice as many positive cores as recommended for AS. I've read posts from men who, themselves, insisted on doing nothing but AS because of a supposedly low Gleason score. One man had a sudden spike in his PSA and ended up having surgery. The post-op pathology revealed (if I recall properly) there was a Gleason 9 in there that had never been detected by previous testing.

He now faces a real uphill battle.

So it is a roll of the dice to go on AS with four positive cores. Can you give us your current and previous PSA readings? While the PSA is not a definitive indicator of Gleason scores, usually the lower PSA numbers are not associated with highly aggressive tumors. But, if I recall, the reference up above also involved a lower Gleason score.

I would consider going to a super-iconic facility such as Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, etc., and get their opinion on whether AS is truly warranted in your particular case. And I would not worry what others have to say. I would basically reply to them, ""how dare you criticize a potentially disease that is victimizing someone else and not yourself?"" In other words, they can offer their thoughts, but it is SOLELY YOUR OWN decision to make since the potential downside is your own personal health issue.

I'm on the somewhat opposite end of the spectrum--I'm procrastinating over surgery, and my wife is pestering the crap out of me about scheduling it! Are your 4 cores uni or bi-lateral (on 1 or both sides of the prostate)? Some AS programs take this into consideration.

While I'm not a particularly religious man, I've generally held the belief that God helps those that help themselves. I'd say if you're a ""believer"" then those people in the clean white coats, as well as all of that fancy equipment, are a product of God and are here at His will to help us--and you!

Kind of like the joke:
There was a preacher who fell in the ocean and he couldn't swim. When a boat came by, the captain yelled, ""Do you need help, sir?"" The preacher calmly said ""No, God will save me."" A little later, another boat came by and a fisherman asked, ""Hey, do you need help?"" The preacher replied again, ""No God will save me."" Eventually the preacher drowned & went to heaven. The preacher asked God, ""Why didn't you save me?"" God replied, ""Fool, I sent you two boats!""

Excellent post, dday,

A great example of what I'm trying to say about ""rolling the dice"" with AS.
Please keep in mind that some people are willing to ""roll the dice"". Nothing wrong with making that choice, taking some risk.

In fact, many men live rolling the dice every day for other parts of their health, yet somehow put prostate cancer into some other category. Perhaps because its the C word.
The truth is that a good percentage of men over age 50 live every day, month, and year, with a much much greater chance of death...even instant death... from heart disease and sudden cardiac arrest. Their lifestyle puts them at considerable risk but they seldom treat it with the same extensive care and consideration they assign to their 3+3 or 3+4 prostate cancer biopsy.

So in fact, knowingly, or unknowingly, huge numbers of men are ""rolling the dice"" all the time. Including many of those who are not inclined to take any chances with AS...thinking it too risky.
I don't think it inappropriate to mix the two types of ""rolling the dice""

This doesn't mean that because someone ignores their heart attack risk, that they should also ignore their prostate cancer risk.
I'm only pointing out a incongruity in the way so many seem to assign risk.. or avoid risk.

Interestingly many of the steps to mitigate heart risk are also thought to lessen prostate cancer risks, even for those who have already undergone treatment.";"";"Otago";"http://www.cancerforums.net/members/10792-Otago";"";"Top User";"Jan 2008";"Not Found";"639"

A suggestion would be to add another, recent type of testing to your case. The genomics tests by OncotypeDX and by Prolaris, will provide further risk assessment that can influence your decision, or give you some confidence.

Right now, to the best of my knowledge, you are on the edge of AS eligibility IF the cores are all on one side AND the G4 <= 10 percent.

If Wayne meets with Dr Garnick, or any other expert MD, I'll be interested in their opinions.

The ""newer"" tests: PCA3, PHI scores, genetic bio markers may provide a more accurate assessment of Wayne's status on a cellular or sub cellular level.

Certainly, no one wants to ""Watch & Wait"" too long and then later down the road say: ""I should have acted sooner.""

Ultimately, Wayne will make a sound decision in concurrence with his MD Team.

I worked in a law enforcement capacity for the federal govt for 26 yrs. As such, I was obligated to go for a govt-paid physical once per year in order to remain in an enforcement position. The physical included a DRE in which I was so vehemently opposed to having that Uncle Sam agreed to conduct prostate screening for me by paying (extra mind you) for a PSA blood test. After about 10 yrs, the govt Drs noticed a gradual increase in PSAs fron low 1's to mid-3's. After I retired in 2008, my urologist continued to perform PSA screening which remained in the 3's until starting to rise over last couple of years. In early Nov, 2014 my PSA was at 5.1...mildly elevated...and my urologist decided to retest and include a % free PSA screen with the next blood draw. These results were a concern as my PSAs rose only slightly to 5.3 but % free PSA came back at only 8%. He explained that free PSAs under 25% bear watching closely and anything less than 10% requires some additional action. So, despite my refusal to undergo DRE testing for years working for Uncle Sam (which ironically may have saved my life!) I agreed to a prostate biopsy. The results are what brings me to this forum. Again, thanks for your input Chuck.

The general (and they are just guidelines) rules of thumb to qualify for Active Surveillance are:
* no more than 2 positive cores
* no positive core more than 50% involvement
* Gleason score no higher than 6
* PSA not in double figures

The main thing is that you have twice as many positive cores as recommended for AS. I've read posts from men who, themselves, insisted on doing nothing but AS because of a supposedly low Gleason score. One man had a sudden spike in his PSA and ended up having surgery. The post-op pathology revealed (if I recall properly) there was a Gleason 9 in there that had never been detected by previous testing.

He now faces a real uphill battle.

So it is a roll of the dice to go on AS with four positive cores. Can you give us your current and previous PSA readings? While the PSA is not a definitive indicator of Gleason scores, usually the lower PSA numbers are not associated with highly aggressive tumors. But, if I recall, the reference up above also involved a lower Gleason score.

I would consider going to a super-iconic facility such as Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, etc., and get their opinion on whether AS is truly warranted in your particular case. And I would not worry what others have to say. I would basically reply to them, ""how dare you criticize a potentially disease that is victimizing someone else and not yourself?"" In other words, they can offer their thoughts, but it is SOLELY YOUR OWN decision to make since the potential downside is your own personal health issue.

Yup, it's the rise in PSA numbers, rather than the individual number by itself, that is usually the indicator of prostate cancer. I'm glad that those PSA tests eventually paid off for you so you are able to nip it in the bud.

I'd say if you're a ""believer"" then those people in the clean white coats, as well as all of that fancy equipment, are a product of God and are here at His will to help us--and you!

Kind of like the joke:
There was a preacher who fell in the ocean and he couldn't swim. When a boat came by, the captain yelled, ""Do you need help, sir?"" The preacher calmly said ""No, God will save me."" A little later, another boat came by and a fisherman asked, ""Hey, do you need help?"" The preacher replied again, ""No God will save me."" Eventually the preacher drowned & went to heaven.

Prior to the surgery, the plan was that the lymph nodes would be sampled with additional nodes to be removed if they looked enlarged.

Right after the surgery, DH's surgeon told me that there weren't many lymph nodes there, that there was a lot of fatty tissue on one side, but that he did sample the nodes.

The post-op pathology report states that two lymph nodes were removed, one from the right side and one from the left. The report describes the specimen labeled ""left pelvic lymph node"" but then states:

""Sectioning reveals unremarkable adipose tissue, no lymph node grossly is identified.""

It looks as if the surgeon intended to take out a lymph node from the left side but ended up only with fatty tissue. So where are the lymph nodes on that side?

We meet with the surgeon later today and I'm not sure what to ask. Has anyone else had this happen? More importantly, should we be concerned, given the size and how close it was to the capsule, that no lymph node sampling was done on that one side? There had to be lymph nodes there, somewhere, right?

Each person is different, and locations of lymphnodes arr pribably not the exacf same for everyone. Given that it was negative for extraprostatic extension, negative for seminal vessicle involvement, and negative for the node that was sampled, I wouldn't worry myself sick over it. Chances are still very much in favor thst the surgeon ""got it all"". Just keep up with the PSA tests post op that are to come. As long as they come out as zero, or undetectable according to the physician, then he should be in good shape, even if they didnt find the other nodes they intended to examine. If the PSA should rise on consecutive readings, there are several options still available with the intent for cure. Salvage radiation being probably the gold standard for that scenario.

"09-03-2014";" 02:43 AM";"Hi Mimi, - Lymph Nodes are found on both sides of the body and I can completely understand why you ""wonder"" when a supposed lymph node can't be ""grossly identified"" (seen by the naked eye), when that was what it is supposed to have been excised.

But pragmatically, it makes little difference now, since the surgery has been completed and only one lymph node was present upon pathologic examination and that one was ""negative"" for PCa involvement. This finding is good, but with only one lymph node examined, its true value is deflated to a point of relatively limited significance.

ALL of this, however, is trumped by the results of future PSA monitoring that is necessary with ALL forms of treatment.
.
Let's look at the additional FAVORABLE aspects of his â€œpathologicâ€ results: No EPE (extra-prostatic extension)= Good, No SVI (seminal vesicle involvement)= VERY good and the identified PNI appears to have been found in tissue within the Prostate Capsule (intra-) rather than having escaped outside.= Good

For reference purposes: a ""normal"" adult Prostate, UNAFFECTED by BPH (Benign Prostate Hyperplasia or Hypertrophy), USALLY runs between 20 to 24cc in size. BPH is the natural (non-cancerous) growth of the Prostate that occurs in most men (in widely varying degrees) after about 40 years of age, often continuing to increase in size as age advances

The tumors â€œpathologicâ€ result of pT2 is the LOWEST (most favorable), and also the most common, found in American men that are diagnosed today. There is NOT a T1 tumor classification in the â€œpathologicâ€ TNM Staging System UNLIKE the â€œclinicalâ€ TNM Tables that do include a T1 designation.

The â€œclinicalâ€ designation is applicable to Biopsy Pathology Reports and other testing that report only on SAMPLES of the whole Prostate. Therefore there is always the rhetorical question as to whether the SAMPLES accurately reflect the state of ALL cancer that may be present in the TOTAL Prostate Gland. A significant number do not!

ONLY men choosing radical surgery as their primary treatment have the advantage of the Pathology results from the much more accurately reliable â€œpathologicâ€ Pathology Report, due to the POST-SURGICAL availability of the entire excised Prostate Gland for direct examination.

To better understand the relative risk of recurrence, letâ€™s put your husbandâ€™s present situation into the easily understood context of the most reliable estimation of the future risk for recurrence, in my OPINION.

Under the latest recommended Johns Hopkins system for more clearly defining â€œprognostic riskâ€ based upon Gleason Score reporting, your husband would be classified as Group 2 out of 5 progressively worsening risk categories.

The group 2 risk category is next to the most favorable ranking possible and is there because it most often progresses most similarly with the very favorable Gleason 6 and under.

Five Gleason Groups Based on Prognosis

Prognostic Group I:
Gleason score <=6,

Prognostic Group II:
Gleason score 3+4=7

Prognostic Group III:
Gleason score 4+3=7

Prognostic Group IV:
Gleason score 8

Prognostic Group V:
Gleason score 9-10 .

If you wish to see the entire article summarizing their results, contact me at the e-mail listed in my signature and I will provide a copy by return e-mail. I believe this helps put things in a proper and more understandable, perspective for many patients.

So, all in all, your husbandâ€™s future looks pretty darn good, as far as contemplated Cancer control
is concerned although, as you know, no results can be guaranteed. Congratulations on the favorable
prognosis and I hope this helps better deal with your concerns. â€“ John@newPCa.org (aka) az4peaks";"";"az4peaks";"http://www.cancerforums.net/members/18151-az4peaks";"";"Senior User";"Aug 2014";"Seattle area, WA";"47"

Ideally a individual would begin slowly increasing fiber years ahead of time. It a good idea in that it directs you into eating foods that are healthy without ""adding"" fiber via artificial means. Best to get fiber from real food.

For those who are following a rising psa, and possible negative biopsies, you might assume that in a few years you may want surgery, so start now eating right.
Then for those who get a positive biopsy and are thinking about surgery, begin now to transition to higher fiber foods.
Most men will have two months prior to surgery, by which time your system will be acclimated to the diet.
Sudden large increases in fiber is normally not recommended for anyone, pre surgery, post surgery, or any time.

BTW someone mentioned that fiber filled foods contain lots and calories and can lead weight gain.
Actually the opposite is true. The fiber itself has a low amount of carbs relative to the fiber and calories involved.
That ""carb"" idea is part of the recent trend/fad concept surrounding the ""low-carb"" and ""paleo"" diet mania.

I know of no sensible or healthy diet that would avoid fiber.

Though most men here are already well into diagnosis and treatment, as a general rule, they ought to be aiming for and advising friends to follow a diet more in line with that found at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (San Francisco)

""Fiber contains a lot of carbs which can lead to weight gain unless you are quite active and burning the calories. ""

You might re-read your comment.
The carb--> weight gain idea has really gotten a bit out of hand recently, such that even non-processed whole foods which happen to have fiber are being thrown into the hopper as being little different than Wonder Bread or Twinkies.

As to ""dramatically"" changing one's diet in the month(s) leading up to surgery, I agree that may be problematic and unwise.
However a gradual change to higher fiber in most men who lack adequate fiber (the norm) I would think would be welcomed by most doctors.
Above all, not suddenly loading up on fiber the days following surgery as was mentioned in the original post.
Slowly increasing fiber intake over two or more months leading up to surgery should not cause a problem.

The term ""well balanced diet"" means so many things to so many people. We do know that most men don't eat enough fiber, vegetables, fruit, and at the same time eat too much highly processed carbs and sugars. Almost everyone agrees with that picture of the average American male.
One only need visit the local mall to see that on display with 65% of men being either overweight or obese.
Extra weight itself being a risk factor for prostate cancer both before and after diagnosis.

Interestingly in those few prostate cancer centers where dietary changes are recommended for preventative or during AS, they follow a fairly similar set of recommendations. Not dissimilar those put forth by UCSF which a major center for prostate cancer treatment and research.

UCSF http://cancer.ucsf.edu/_docs/crc/nutrition_prostate.pdf

From John Hopkins
""The bottom line is that a diet that is low in animal and dairy fat, high in a wide variety of fruits and vegetables and healthy grains and nuts, is thought be a diet that can slow the progression of cancer.""

From Mayo Clinic http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-c...n/art-20045641

No magic in that advice. Probably much more valuable if followed from age 10 onward, which is impossible for 98% of us.
I don't disagree with your doctors advice leading up to surgery.

Even in overall dietary advice, doctors have no proof a given diet will alter the course of events in a given patient.
Understandable that doctors won't suddenly have their patients alter their lifestyle.
However if one was advising 20 year olds on healthy eating for their future prostate health I think many doctors might make some suggestions.
Most of which would be ignored.

Finally the dietary changes most often recommended for prostate health are the same ones suggested for healthy hearts which is a far more dangerous condition for 97% of men than is prostate cancer.";"";"Otago";"http://www.cancerforums.net/members/10792-Otago";"";"Top User";"Jun 2013";"Not Found";"916"

Well the original post was specifically about fiber.

However if you give me a choice of great diet or great genetics and I'll take great genetics every time.
I have a much better lifestyle and diet than my older brother yet his psa remains at less than 1.0 while mine dances around 4.0.
My father had prostate cancer and clearly I got some portion of that genetic package while my brother did not.

The fact that you ate a great diet and got prostate cancer doesn't make me want to throw out the outlook and advice from some of those major cancer centers. More importantly, as I mentioned and always mention, that while the dietary changes may only have a weak influence on any given individual's outcome regarding prostate cancer, it has a much more proven effect on their heart health and in most men that is a much more likely problem than is prostate cancer regarding longevity.
So I see it as wise choice even if it does little to alter one's specific prostate cancer course.

Heart disease, and or diabetes will affect a the majority of men on this site to one degree or another.
If the dietary changes influence the progression of prostate cancer that is a added bonus.

Just so I'm not misunderstood. Regarding prostate cancer, diet is a tool, but a weak tool to alter outcomes. I choose to take advantage of that tool and go with the odds that it may help, alter, or slow, progression.

I am sorry it has taken me so long to get back with everyone but a lot has happened in my world since my last post.
I sincerely hope that all of my friends are doing well. I have not been on the forum much but I decided to have some fun.

I have been on the Testosterone Replacement Therapy since November 28th and since then my T level has been steady.
My first shot was 250mg twice a week and took my T level from .4 to 1170 and my PSA stayed at .2. The Doctor has been lowering the dosage steadily since my desired range was about 800.
We are down to 50mg 2 time a week now and my T level is still in the 1100 range.
My PSA is still <.4 and the superman effect kicked in in December. I am sure I still have some residue of the HT in my system since I am still an emotional boob.
My wife is pleased ,but had to go to the Gyno and he found a significant tear, so we had to abstain for a month for repairs.
On January 29th 2012 my heart went into afib and I spent 3 days in ICU to get it under control.. I was schedule for surgery on the first of Feb, for my severe cervical stenosis but everything is on hold since the onslaught of the afib and all the blood thinners etc.
On 3-3-12 my wife requested a CT scan of the brain thinking I might have had a mini stroke because I was having some memory problems and balance problems ( falling ) after my afib thing.
They did the CT and found a 4cm Arachnoid Cyst in my left ventricular , right atria of my brain. Followed up with MRI and saw a Surgeon and was told it was inoperable due to the location and not to play football.
I studied for weeks and found that only 4% of the worlds population gets these things and only 1% of those are adults with .10 percent of adults get it in this location., The location make it even more rare. I was set to go to Duke University but why spend a $1,000 bucks only to find there is nothing that can be done. That would be pursuing worry is all and that is not my style.
I have had some bad luck since I started the TRT but I know that getting my life back was most important. It has been frustration because with all this other stuff going on , I have been unable to exercise properly but it has been a world of difference and worth every thing that I have gone through.
All in all I have my life back and I an sure that will get past these other things soon.
I hope to hear from my friend and get some advice if possible so please don't be afraid to ask questions.
Thanks to all for your patience.

Wow, you have been through a lot since your last post. Welcome back and hope things will work out for you.

I really don't know how to respond. Many doctors are cautious about TRT for prostate cancer patients so I am interested in your results and experiences. Sorry you are having some problems which I hope are not related to TRT. But, I am happy to know that you are ""getting your life back"".

Good luck and cheers.";"";"newporter";"http://www.cancerforums.net/members/21257-newporter";"";"Top User";"Jan 2011";"S.W. Florida";"70"

I have been a little worried in the back of my mind just as anyone would be by taking a chance like am.
I have my life back now but they keep finding these other things to contend with that are totally unexpected and unrelated to PC.
I am not trying to influence anyone into doing what I am doing because I know how dangerous and possibly foolish it is. However I would rather live like I feel now as opposed to what I was 6 months ago. I was already dead even though I was still breathing. Quality of life was something I took for granted until it was gone. It got to a point with me that if I still had pc then it was going to resurface at some point and time anyways. At least I am spending time with my son now and making up for 2 years with my wife as well. I abused my body physically all of my life and some of the spinal problems derive from that as well as the heart problems. That part is hereditary anyways.
I hope things are going well for you and yours and that continues.
My philosophy has always been ""cheer up, things will get worse"" and that seems to be the current trend for me, but I will plow forward till the quest is futile.

"07-20-2011";" 12:08 AM";"I learned something firsthand today.

I have been on ""Lupron"" (or Eligard) testosterone suppressant for years, with negligible PSA until last fall. My PSA started rising, in the last nine months going from .01 to .08 to .16 to .3 to .9 to 1.4 to 2.8 each time (2.8 in June). That is DOUBLING or TRIPLING each time. I was getting worried about ""refraction"", where the testosterone-dependent cancer ""decides"" it has had enough with its food ""rationing"" and develops a ""taste"" for something else, rendering the Lupron ineffective and useless. I though I was there. I thought the next step was radiation or chemo.

But my oncologist had a hunch that the varieties of testosterone the Lupron was suppressing were not all there were, and so put me on Casodex as well to stop the last ""holdout"" testosterone my body was manufacturing. We knew it might take more than a month for results. We got the results! My PSA had DROPPED from nearly 3.0 to .8--so he was right after all! That gives me a reprieve, and buys me some time, but ""the cancer"" was ""clever"" enough to switch to something else than it had been feeding on previously, so I am not out of the woods yet.

But----I won *A* battle in this war!";"T-3, Gleason 9+

"07-21-2011";" 04:17 AM";"There is another explanation..Many times, the Lupron / Eligard drug does not lower testosterone to true castrate levels, or it's ability to do so wears off, allowing the cancer to gain strength..as the ""T"" level rises..Not only should you have your PSA level checked, but have your ""T"" level tested too.

My PSA was rising dramatically IN SPITE OF ""castration""-level testosterone from the Lupron (measured as ""less than 20"" for years). The lower end of the ""chart"" of testosterone numbers for my tests was 20. The addition of Casodex didn't change the testosterone number of the tests themselves (already ""off the chart"" on the low end), but obviously lowered the type of testosterone upon which the cancer was feeding.

June 2014 - started 2 year maintenance Rituxin, 1 infusion every 3 months. Doctor confirms lump under right arm are ""suspicious"" for recurrent disease, deferring scans for now.
February 2015 - Doc and I agreed to stop R maintenance as it is depressing my immune system too much.
June 2015 - Confirm that the beast is back by physical exam, will scan in August after esophageal issues settle down so we can get a clear view.
August 2015 - physical exam in error, PET/CT shows no evidence of disease. Remission continues well into second year!
December 2015 - Cardiologist tells me I have plaque buildup growing at an alarming rate. Stent or bypass down the road but not yet...
March 2016 - new tumor below the jaw so remission is over. Back to active surveillance until treatment is needed.
June 2016 - C/T scan indicates presence of multiple lesions in iliac chain.

Biopsy to check for transformation 1/18/2013 - negative for that but full of lymphoma, of course.
July 2013 - Rescan due to progression shows one tumor (among many) very suspect for transformation, another biopsy 8/12/13.
August 2013 - No evidence of transformation, 6 courses of B+R commence 8/29 due to ""extensive, systemic disease"".
February 2014 - Diagnostic PET scan states: Negative PET scan. Previous noted hypermetabolic cervical, axillary, iliac and inguinal lymphadenopathy has resolved. Doctor confirms full remission.
June 2014 - started 2 year maintenance Rituxin, 1 infusion every 3 months. Doctor confirms lump under right arm are ""suspicious"" for recurrent disease, deferring scans for now.
February 2015 - Doc and I agreed to stop R maintenance as it is depressing my immune system too much.
June 2015 - Confirm that the beast is back by physical exam, will scan in August after esophageal issues settle down so we can get a clear view.
August 2015 - physical exam in error, PET/CT shows no evidence of disease. Remission continues well into second year!
December 2015 - Cardiologist tells me I have plaque buildup growing at an alarming rate. Stent or bypass down the road but not yet...
March 2016 - new tumor below the jaw so remission is over. Back to active surveillance until treatment is needed.
June 2016 - C/T scan indicates presence of multiple lesions in iliac chain.
August 2016 - PET/CT shows multiple areas of lymphoma as expected plus new areas of concern in bowel.";"Kermica";"http://www.cancerforums.net/members/16915-Kermica";"Administrator";"Top User";"May 2016";"Toutle Washington USA";"47"

I do hope you read this which I was hesitant to post anyway.
Kermica is quite correct that we have seen many with hidden agendas, therefore we (collectively) try and ensure that any member that join abide by the rules and have which you do a open and honest intention.

I also am very actively involved with a major UK based cancer support charity, in my time on this forum I have never mentioned either the name of the charity nor linked to its site.
Slightly different I admit as my help is on a one to one face to face basis both in home and at two hospitals as well as three hospices.
Being face to face I assure you is on many occasions extremely distressing and has out of sight of the patients and families reduced me to tears.
Holding the hands or hand on shoulder or head at the moment of passing is heart wrenching I assure you and indelibly changes ones perspective.

This site is in my opinion a family of over 50,000, each and every one is a family member and we are extremely protective of our family.

I can only support what others have said, you are most welcome to remain and in post support our extended family.
For this I would thank you.

Even after a bowel movement, there is no relief from the feeling.

Anyway, after having 2 colonoscopys done that showed nothing abnormal, I had a pelvic CT scan, and the report showed everything normal except for the following:

"" The prostate is heterogeneous and measures 4.1 x 2.8 cm.""

""There is a sclerotic density in the left sacrum and a punctate sclerotic densities in bilateral femoral heads which are nonspecific and may represent bone islands.""

The gastroenterologist didn't mention either of these points (I saw it on the report afterwards), he just said the CT was normal and referred me to a rectal surgeon to see if my problem is muscle related.

When I search 'heterogeneous prostate' on the internet, the results are almost exclusively about prostate cancer. Is this a cause for concern, or can it be a normal result on a CT scan?";"";"jarl";"http://www.cancerforums.net/members/103558-jarl";"Newbie";"New User";"May 2013";"Not Found";"3"

The symptoms you describe ARE common for someone with a mass in the colon, but given the 2 normal colonoscopies, I'd say you're probably safe from colon cancer. You are only 24, which would be very unusual if you were to have prostate cancer. You could certainly see a urologist for tests to confirm that you do not have prostate cancer.

At your young age, it is extremely unlikely that you would have prostate cancer, so you should be okay there. For peace of mind, however, a PSA check could probably be done, although the test, in itself, cannot diagnose prostate cancer.

Regarding the full feeling your are having in the colon. Here is my dumb question for the day -- is it even remotely possible that you might have a significant case of hemorrhoids that might be flaring up and making themselves felt? This could give a similar feeling to what you describe.

There are conventional treatments for prostate cancer, and Ukrain is a substance that has yet to be proven effective against prostate cancer.

With T3a stage cancer, I think radiation would be a viable strategy, since it can treat cancer that has escaped the prostate but is still nearby. I had both surgery and radiation, and of the two, radiation was a very easy treatment, and the side effects almost non-existent.

Chemoman n replicant,

We did having some consultations with the oncologist.
In malaysia n thailand, they suggest us an operation, which my husband doesnt want to take it. The reason for not doing this is that he had through past experience with his late wife which have a breast cancer for 5 years before. They done surgery and chemo, but in the end, this comin back to her and spread even quicker after surgery and chemo. Of course everyone is different, but life quality is better without havin operation and chemo, to him, from the past experience.
In england, the second consultation with the oncologist come to suggestion for hormone treatment, but we're not sure yet what to do since we still have next appoinment to come to see final options that they going to offer.
This ukrain is reference to us by our doctor in malaysia where my husband go for Ozone detox treatment. He said he has try this treatment before for his patients and it give a good result.
I read few people had the ukrain here, but no further report on the progress...
I just hope some people with come with the latest update on it....

Ran high temp. third cycle he was not able to eat or drink and ran temp again. by 5th day after chemo he had to go in for IV fluids and IV antibiotics and IV nausea medications two times. Our dr said chemo starts out not to bad but with every cycle the side effects get more intense. Hope for the best but plan for the worse. He had no problems the day of treatment but I have learned not to make any plans as You never know if he will feel good enought to attend.

My only suggestion would be to try to get your oncologist to do it weekly, because a third of the dose weekly, seems much more tolerable than the full dose every 3 weeks.

Currently I have the first week of each month off, and have treatment every Wednesday.

30 treatments since June 2014 and still going .... My signature has my history.

Very effective to date, side effects quite bearable .... Have a farm, still work at a steady pace .... Sometime quite steady, but I have ridden a couple of horses this morn and a few other chores.

"03-30-2015";" 05:57 PM";"I agree .... and each person will react differently anyway, as you say.

The oncologist tells me the treatment I am on is palliative, purely for symptom control, so most probably stage 4 .... not sure what the M1a and M1b stand for. Some different terms used between Australia and USA.

Still think weekly is a good option if you can get it .... I wouldn't under estimate the side effects, but just trying to give you hope that it may be better than you think.

Last June a palliative care Doctor, the General Practitioner, and the Oncologist all told me I should measure my life span in months, not years (because of the pelvic invasion), but because of the success of treatment to date, that has not been the case ... At least to this stage anyway.

I'm no Doctor, simply the patient .... I think from talking to others in Day Oncology, that Docetaxel (Taxotere) is also used for women with breast cancer, and from my observation the side effects of the 3 weekly dose can be quite severe.

Chemo effects so many different part of our body and if you already have a weak heart/ slow liver or other extras it is harder to handle the side effects. Steve detoxes after his chemo to flush out the left over chemo that is not working. Our physician said remember starting late in the disease means it will not cure just buy more time and make you feel better. In Steve story that is true. He feels good most days and works. He just brought a new harley davidson, I think when the physician said you might not be stronge enough to ride this summer it made Steve say I will show you and today after chemo yesterday he is riding his harley.

Glad he started chemo. It should help.

Docetaxel was one part of my wife's chemo regimen and the side effects were quite severe. The worst things for her were nausea, lack of energy among others. Fortunately she endured. She had adjuvant radiation and adjuvant chemo after surgery for her breast cancer which had spread by the time it was diagnosed. We are grateful her oncologist was super aggressive and essentially threw everything at it. She is in remission for over 13 years now. Let's hope your husband has the same outcome.

JD1969. Sorry about your PSA results. Looks like your PSA is not undetectable. There are two possibilities: cancer has escaped or some benign prostate tissues may be left behind. Looking at your pathology report summary, looks like you had positive margin on one side with EPE and seminal vesicle involvement so it is possible the cancer has escaped causing the PSA.

If all cancer cells and benign cells are out, a one month PSA test should be undetectable. PSA half life in your body is between 2 to 3 days which means with an initial PSA of 10, within 30 days, it should be down to .01 or less.

I suggest you consult an oncologist and a radiation oncologist to plan you next attack and hopefully the cancer is still local, in the prostate bed and can be eradicated. No lymph node involvement is a good sign.

Again, I am not a healthcare provider so it is just a layperson speculation and could be wrong.

That is exactly what is happening to me. For some reason, at night I was really holding a ton and would empty very thoroughly, but days have been more difficult with some burning, weak stream and small volume. Lately the volume has been steadily increasing and the burning and discomfort becoming less.
I am at eight weeks right now and had been on shields since the catheter came out; never really felt a soaked one but sensed occasional drips, pinches, and squirts for the first six weeks (or thought I did) but it is summer here in Houston and with the little man under all of the clothes and then sheathed in a polyethylene (or whatever it is) tent to boot, there is so much moisture down there anyway it is hard to tell. I quit the shields a couple of weeks ago and have been doing okay with only two legitimate squirts on record since then; one out of nowhere when I had the remote in hand and was looking for a tv channel to watch, and the other one today when I was in my truck, discreetly trying to re-arrange my junk for a more comfortable ride at a red light. There is really no rhyme or reason to these random squirts, it seems...I just think of it as part of the healing.

I found this as well. Your pee-muscles have been traumatized. And they aren't big like a bicep or chest muscle to begin with. They have to work anyway even without kegels.

"08-20-2015";" 03:48 PM";"Today marks two weeks post-op for me. I've been pretty lucky so far with incontinence and everything else. My wife and I even fooled around two days ago and I got a decent erection for a while (my surgeon put me on daily Cialis 5 mg after the operation).

I wear a pad in the day and only squirt a tiny bit when I laugh, get up fast or cough. I am totally dry at night and even slept in the raw last night. I had been getting up a lot at night to piss but last night I drank my two beers earlier (before 6 p.m.) and slept much better, waking up only three times.

I am not sure I am doing the kegels correctly although I try to squeeze a few in whenever I think of it.

I had an interesting thing happen today. My car is in the shop so I had to drive my old Ford 150 pickup to school to pick up some books I need to get ready for classes in two weeks. The pickup is a clumsy beast with a standard transmission and every time I pushed the clutch down and shifted I felt a tiny squirt. The funny thing is that, even though I feel these squirts at least a dozen times daily, at the end of the day the pad seems dry or close to dry.";"Last edited by PDV; 08-20-2015 at 03:58 PM.

"08-20-2015";" 06:46 PM";"Hey DD! Absolutely a great exercise! My post catheter instructions were to avoid frequent trips to the bathroom simply to empty the bladder. When in a ""controlled"" environment (i.e. at home or where you are close to a bathroom or woods) hold it to slightly beyond the point of discomfort. This will retrain your bladder to fill to capacity and retrain you to hold it longer without having an accident.

When running errands around town I'll fight the urge no matter how bad until I get home. Often this exercise has me dashing to the bushes behind the garage!!! But I explain to my wife that urine is good fertilizer. Simply take a look at bag of garden fertilizer and Urea is the main Nitrogen containing component of fertilizer (and urine!)

The other day she caught me out back with a tape measure. ""What are you doing?"" she asked. I proudly informed her that I hit a target 3 1/2 feet away! She thinks I've completely flown off the rail!

The good news for the recent RP Brothers is that it definitely gets better and there is strong likelihood that you will get back to nearly 100% normal continence.

I still experience a small squirt or 2 when doing abdominal exercises at the gym. These are avoided by hitting the urinal and emptying the bladder first. The only other time occurs when attending a wedding with lots of beer, wine, water & dancing. This remains the only time I'll take a pad with me and put it in my pocket in case it is needed. But haven't had to use one in the last several weddings.

Catheter is more of an annoyance at this point. I keep it clean. I remember to walk around with my buddy. I get a shooting pain every so often thats not terrible, just gets my attention. Occasionally I get what feels like (Don't be mad if I am being too graphic) a pain in the head that you have if you have been erect too long. It passes pretty fast. Its just a really strong ache for a few seconds.

I never thought I would ever be excited about it, but the 'morning wood' that I had two or three days ago was confirmed again this morning. Dang that hurt because of the catheter but, its so worth it to know the hydraulics are operational.

Yea, so I woke the wife up to tell her, she didn't share my excitement at 0430.

My JP drain was draining about 300-400CC per day total. This morning the dump was completed at 0645 and it was 75CC so I think that it might finally be slowing down.

Anyways, stay safe my friends. Maybe I am going to be one of the guys that ends up in pretty good shape after this is over.

I am already doing a ton better than my Command Master Chief that I work for. He is well over 6 weeks and still has his catheter and a Drain, has been back in the hospital twice since surgery for infections and urine leaks.

Yes I suffered the foggy brain, couldn't keep a theme in my head at work for ages.. folk comment on how quick I recovered from that I didn't know any different.

Well, I wouldn't call it ""hard wood"", more like balsa... But it was still there, in the middle of the night, without any help from ""Mr Palm and his five friends""...

Anyway, I went to the Dr, he tool a urine culture (clean), he looked and pulled and poked around and didn't find anything. So maybe it was just some irritation, and said not to worry about it and be very glad that my little friend seem to be awaking from his almost year-long hibernation.

Should PSA levels be â€œundetectableâ€ at 5 years after successful brachytherapy?
Posted on April 6, 2010 by Sitemaster

Most brachytherapy centers today use the Phoenix criteria to define clinical success and failure after brachytherapy. But a new paper suggests that brachytherapy can (and perhaps should) use a higher standard for long-term follow-up.
In an article in press in the on-line UroToday International Journal, Barrett and Herzfeld have carried out a retrospective review of data from 163 consecutive patients treated with radioactive iodine-125 seed implantation as definitive treatment between 1996 and 2003. None of these patients received external radiation or hormone therapy as adjunctive treatment. All patients were followed for a minimum of 3 years, and their PSA levels were drawn 1 month and 3 months following the implant, every 3 months for the rest of the first year, and every 4 to 6 months thereafter. A single PSA assay method was used to assess all PSA levels for these patients over this time period.
The authors carefully analyzed data on the post-brachytherapy PSA levels of all 163 patients, categorizing them as â‰¤ 0.1, â‰¤ 0.2, â‰¤ 0.3, and â‰¤ 0.5 ng/ml.
All 163 patients lacked clincial evidence of extraprostatic disease at the time of treatment. The majority of patients were clinical stage T1c, but ranged from T1a through stage T2c. The median Gleason score was 6 (range, 5 to . The median PSA level was 6 ng/ml (range, 1.6 to 17.7 ng/ml). Thus the series included patients with low, intermediate, and high risk for progression.
The authors also note that at the time of original treatment and follow-up for these patients, biochemical failure was based on the ASTRO consensus definition, which was three consecutive rises in PSA at least 3 months apart from each other. The Phoenix criteria used today define biochemical failure after radiation therapy as a PSA level equal to the lowest (nadir) PSA level achieved after therapy plus 2 ng/ml.
By comparison, the standard expectation for a PSA after radical prostatectomy today is an â€œundetectableâ€ level, usually taken to mean a PSA level of < 0.1 ng/ml. (Although several different PSA levels have been used in the literature over time to define clinical success and failure after radical prostatectomy.)
Bartlett and Herzog were able to show the following results in this series of patients:
At a median follow-up of 85.2 months (about 7 years), 120/163 patients (73.6 percent) achieved and maintained an undetectable PSA level (< 0.1 ng/ml).
The median time to achievement of an undetectable PSA level was 40 months following the brachytherapy implant.
The mean and the median number of PSAs obtained per patient was 19.
91/140 patients who were biochemically free of disease (64 percent), based on the ASTRO consensus criteria, experienced a PSA bounce (transient elevation).
23/163 patients (14.1 percent) experienced biochemical recurrence by the ASTRO consensus statement definition.
None of the patients who obtained an undetectable PSA following prostate brachytherapy had a subsequent rising PSA.
131/163 patients (80.4 percent) patients achieved and maintained a PSA level â‰¤ 0.2 ng/ml.
136/163 patients (83.4 percent) patients achieved and maintained a PSA level â‰¤ 0.3 ng/ml.
139/163 patients (85.3 percent) achieved and maintained a PSA level â‰¤ 0.5 ng/ml.
Only 6/23 patients who had a biochemical recurrence according to the ASTRO consensus statement received salvage therapy of any type.
It is also worth noting the following results in the 26 patients with a prostate volume > 50 cm3:, none of whom received neoadjuvant hormonal therapy to decrease prostate volume:
15/26 patients (57 percent) had undetectable PSA levels (< 0.1 ng/ml) and 17/26 patients (65 percent) had PSAs â‰¤ 0.2 ng/ml.
Biochemical failure, according to the ASTRO consensus definition, occurred in 5/26 patients (19.2 percent).
What is interesting in looking at these data is (a) the extended time it takes for the patients to achieve a PSA level < 0.1 ng/ml as compared to the surgical patients and (b) the fact that it is, in fact, an apparently achievable endpoint. It is tempting to wonder whether 5-year and 10-year outcomes for brachytherapy patients should in fact be reported on this basis, permitting a direct â€œapples to applesâ€ comparison of outcomes of brachytherapy patients to surgery patients. As the authors are careful to point out, this series â€œis relatively small and of intermediate follow-up duration.â€ However, they are still able to conclude that, â€œUsing identical biochemical endpoints, brachytherapy appears to confer similar disease-free status to prostatectomy.â€";"July 2011 local PSA lab reading 6.41 (from 4.1 in 2009).

"07-17-2013";" 07:23 AM";"Howdy,

I forgot that my Google search also came up with another article, so I'll paste it down below for you.
It came from: http://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostat...fter-treatment

Following PSA levels during and after treatment
The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level is often a good indicator of how effective treatment is or has been. Generally speaking, your PSA level should get very low after treatment. But PSA results aren't always cut and dry, and sometimes doctors aren't sure what they mean.

Before starting treatment, you might want to ask your doctor what he or she expects your PSA level to be during and after treatment, and what levels might be concerning. But it's important to realize that the PSA level is only one part of the overall picture. Other factors may also play a role in determining if cancer is still present or if it is growing.

It's also important to know that PSA levels may fluctuate a bit on their own in some cases. Many men being treated for prostate cancer are very concerned about even very small changes in their PSA levels. The blood PSA level is an important tool to monitor the cancer, but not every rise in PSA necessarily means that the cancer is growing and requires treatment right away. To help avoid possibly unnecessary anxiety, be sure you understand what level of change in PSA your doctor might consider to be a cause for concern.

During active surveillance

If you choose active surveillance, your PSA level will be monitored closely (most likely along with other tests) to help decide whether the cancer is growing and if other types of treatment should be considered. (See the section, ""Expectant management (watchful waiting) and active surveillance"" for more details.)

After surgery

The PSA should fall to an undetectable level within a couple of months after radical prostatectomy. Because some PSA may remain in the blood for several weeks after surgery, even if all of the prostate cells were removed, doctors often advise waiting at least 6 to 8 weeks after surgery before getting the test.

Blood tests to detect PSA have become much more sensitive in recent years â€“ so sensitive that they can detect very small amounts of PSA. This would seem to be a good thing, but it has made it more difficult to define exactly what an ""undetectable"" PSA level is. For example, a PSA of 0.5 (ng/mL) after surgery might be concerning, but doctors aren't sure whether this is also true of levels of 0.01 or 0.02. Some doctors would advise following such PSA levels over time to get a better idea of what may be going on, possibly with repeat tests every few months. Others might be more inclined to recommend further treatment. Of course, this uncertainty can be very stressful for patients and their families.

Having a detectable PSA level after surgery does not always mean that you still have cancer. If you have a low PSA level that is not rising, it could mean that you just have some benign prostate cells still in your body.

After radiation therapy

The different types of radiation therapy don't kill all of the cells in the prostate gland, so they're not expected to cause the PSA to drop to an undetectable level. The remaining normal prostate cells will continue to make some PSA.

The pattern of the drop in PSA is also different from after surgery. PSA levels after radiation tend to drop gradually, and may not reach their lowest level until 2 years or more after treatment.

Doctors tend to follow the PSA levels every few months to look for trends. A one-time, small rise in PSA might be a cause for closer monitoring, but it may not necessarily mean that the cancer has returned, as PSA levels may fluctuate slightly from time to time. However, a PSA that is rising on consecutive tests after treatment might indicate that cancer is still present. Some medical groups have proposed that if the PSA rises more than 2 above the lowest level it reached, further treatment should be considered, but it's not clear if all doctors agree with this.

There is also a phenomenon called a ""PSA bounce"" that sometimes happens after brachytherapy. The PSA rises slightly for a short time within the first couple of years after treatment, but then falls back down. Doctors aren't sure why this happens, but it doesn't seem to have an effect on a patient's prognosis.

During hormone therapy, chemotherapy, or vaccine therapy

These treatments are used for more advanced prostate cancer. During hormone therapy, chemotherapy, or vaccine therapy, the PSA level can help indicate how well the treatment is working or when it may be time to try a different form of treatment.

Treatments should lower the PSA level (at least at first), although in some cases they may just help keep it from rising further, or even just slow the rise. Of course, other factors, such as whether you are having symptoms from your cancer and whether it is growing based on imaging tests, are also important when deciding if it might be time to change treatments.

If the cancer has spread outside the prostate, the actual PSA level is often not as important as whether it changes, and how quickly it changes. The PSA level itself does not predict whether or not a man will have symptoms or how long he will live. Many men have very high PSA values and feel just fine. Other men have low values and have symptoms.

The last 10 months have been quite stressful for me particularly on the ED front. I'm a relatively young guy and had a very active sex life.
Yes myself and my partner have been very active and imaginative but the non- erection takes its toll psychologically. For me my whole masculinity seems to stem from my penis and to have nothing at all has been devastating. Wives and girlfriends please do not underestimate the confidence knock this has on a man !!!
Up to 5 months i had nothing at all, very cold as well. 6 months I've had some stirrings and a bit of wood nothing to write home about but nonetheless something happening. Slowly but surely things have been improving, injections are the key I think. Cialis doesn't seem to make any difference i take every night. I alternate between viagra and Levitra. Viagra seems to work better. Now at 10 months I'm probably at half mast if I have a viagra and a shower to warm myself up. Just recently managed penetration of sorts.
I guess to round off I've still got a long way to go but I'm improving all the time and am confident i will get back to near where I was pre- op.

Make sure you do not overdo thing and fatigued you muscles. Like other muscles you have in your body, tired muscles do not work well. In addition to exercise, adequate rest, avoid caffeine and diuretics will also help.

It might not be a bad idea to consult your urologist, and also one or two others, and ask about doing just one set as opposed to 200+ kegels a day. I'd really like to know what the various doctors say about it.
I was told by the urologist & the surgeon that prior to the surgery to start doing the Kegels, and to do about 200+ a day. Just not to do them all at one time, but to spread them out over the entire day. So I would do around 15 or 20 several times throughout the day. After the surgery I was told not to do any for the first week after the catheter was removed and then ease back into them during the next week, and working my way back up to about 200 a day.
It all has worked for me.
Every surgeon and urologist has their own procedure and how they want the patient to do that procedure. It may be fitted to each individual patient and that patients circumstances.
For me it is over and I feel great. The surgeon & the urologist has told me that I no longer need to do the Kegels.";"Age: 65 / At surgery

In terms of continence, while there is still day-to-day variability, I am now down to a single pad most days (sometimes barely needed) and none at night. I leaked badly the first week and then had significant progress the next two weeks and then plateaued at 3-4 pads per day for the next several weeks. At the suggestion of my local uro I began biofeedback PT at six weeks and although I have not done many of the suggested exercises besides Kegals and stretching I had a burst of improvement the last couple weeks. Iâ€™m not sure how much of this is attributable to the biofeedback, Kegals, walking, normal healing, or whatever, but in any event Iâ€™m very pleased with how its progressed.

On the potency front, I starting to see some partial but encouraging response at 6 weeks when I started 10mg Cialis q3d. I found things worked much better when standing or using a constriction ring. The response improved rapidly over the last couple weeks and this past weekend with 20mg Cialis and using a constriction band I had an excellent result and some great sex!

So the nerves are suddenly really coming around. I'm sure my relative youth and good health have a lot to do with it, but I still think this rapid recovery is somewhat remarkable especially given that the nerve sparing on the right side was only partial due to the palpable tumor on that side. I have to think that the 300mg Irbesartan I am taking daily since my operation has played a significant role in this. For those who recently had or soon will be having RP, this is something to consider with seemingly very little downside:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23030689

As upright posture / constriction ring have a marked effect, it seems that some venous leakage is part of the picture for me. From what I have read it sounds like venous leakage is a irreversible condition but one that would be unusual to manifest as a side effect of RP so soon post-op -- especially in patient having successful nerve sparing and doing rehab. So I am hoping it may be a relatively slight condition that actually existed pre-operatively and that will not be sufficient to cause problems once the nerves and blood supply fully recover. My surgeon says this venous leakage is does not portend negatively for me and he expects a return to my preoperative performance over the long term.";"Jan '13: PSA 1.23, small nodule on DRE (1st screening @ age 40)

Oh, I don't think there was anything wrong with your decision.
The following was the description of the men in the study

"" The median age of the participants was 62 years (range, 50 to 69), the median PSA level at the prostate-check clinic was 4.6 ng per milliliter (range, 3.0 to 19.9), 77% had tumors with a Gleason score of 6 (on a scale from 6 to 10, with higher scores indicating a worse prognosis), and 76% had stage T1c disease;""

None of the participants had a psa of anywhere near 38

Median PSA2 --- in ng/ml (IQR3) 4.7 (3.7, 6.7) 4.9 (3.7, 6.7) 4.8 (3.7, 6.7)
PSA2 --- 10+ ng/ml (%) 57 (10) 57 (10) 58 (11)

That indicates the median psa for the participants was less than 5 ng/ml and that only 10% of the men had a psa over 10.0
The highest PSA out of over 1,600 men was 19.9, or only half of yours.

Not sure of what to make of the surgeon suggesting you had the choice to monitor it... unless he thought the 38 was just a blip up.";"";"Otago";"http://www.cancerforums.net/members/10792-Otago";"";"Top User";"Jan 2008";"Not Found";"639"

Now the standard 12 core needle biopsy sometimes misses higher grade cancer that is only found if and when the prostate is surgically removed and the entire gland biopsied..But that leaves the MAJORITY of PC cases in the G-6 catagory which it is believed virtually never metastasizes of spreads beyond the prostate gland. This makes 'Doing Nothing"" a good plan for the majority of PC patients..But what about the 40-45% who's Gleason score is something other than Gleason 6? For them ""Doing Nothing"" can be a death sentence. Lets not forget that 35,000 men will DIE from prostate cancer this year..

So when you see these studies that claim treating prostate cancer is a waste of time because treatment apparently has no effect on the mortality rate, I must take these studies with a grain of salt....Today's mortality rate from prostate cancer is much, much lower than it was 30 years ago, before the PSA test and effective treatments.....The G-6 guys never knew they had cancer and the G-8, 9 and 10 guys were dead in two or three years....";"PSA at age 55: 3.5, DRE negative.

Thank you for adding your perspective. You are of course correct. My post op lab put me at G-7, down graded from my biopsy of G-8.

All of the these large PC trials appear to fail to generate the ""Exact"" answers to which treatment modality is optimal for an individual. Also, as Hamdy points out, both detection and treatment technologies (mp MRI, RALP, IMRT) continue to advance. Thus the newly diagnosed PC today likely has a better opportunity for a more optimal outcome. However, even when the ""best"" fit treatment is determined there are multiple future variables that will affect outcome: surgical skill and intraoperative decisions & accurate and precise delivery of radiation dosages will impact success rates.

Dr D'amico wrote an editorial (the 3rd link provided by Otago) which best summarizes the salient take away points of this trial. (BTW, Dr D is Trinity3's Uro-onoclogist) While 50% of the AS group did not require treatment, the AS group yielded the highest # of cases of metastatic PC. This suggests that AS must in fact be Active and careful monitoring protocols must be standardized and adhered to. The Protec T trial should review these individual metastatic AS cases and analyze the degree of AS compliance by each.

"02-28-2012";" 05:12 AM";"I'm finally on the other side. After many months of studying the many PCa treatment options during 2011, as I dealt with waiting for repeat biopsies, I chose to have robotic prostatectomy performed by Dr Li- ming Su at Univ Fla Shands medical center. Surgery was done 11 days ago, Feb 16th, with some nerve sparing. I had a history of prostatitis for many years, and 3 biopsies in the 11 months preceeding surgery, so Dr. Su had advised me there would be some scarring to deal with during the surgery, and he did manage to save some nerves on both sides.

I chose Dr. Su based on his background and experience, and Univ Fla Shands being a half days drive from our home. My wife and I stayed at a motel near the hospital in the week after surgery while waiting for the catheter to come out. Those first 2-3 days after surgery are the toughest, but it gets better very fast.

Catheter came out 8 days after surgery. Final pathology showed the cancer was completely organ confined, Gleason 6, what a huge relief. Now the wait for the PSA tests begins and confirmation.

So far I feel extremely lucky, it's been 3 days since catheter came out, and I already feel like I can just about get thru a day without any pads. Some very small stress leakage with certain physical activity is still occasionally occuring, but the Kegel exercises are already helping with that. I had very little leakage from the minute the catheter came out. The post surgery discomfort was not easy the first 2- 3 days, mainly in the lower abdomen, but I noticed so much improvement every day, I stopped taking any pain medication within 3-4 days of surgery. Overall I have been extremely impressed and pleased with Dr. Su, and his reputation is well deserved.

The biggest challenge will be ED recovery, so far very little sensation in that area, but I'm patient and didn't expect any miracles yet. I think progress here will take some time.

I'm already getting impatient to get back to the gym, but I think it's better to wait at least a month after surgery.";"Age 57

I have my 11 Month Post surgery PSA next Monday. Anxiety is growing.
My urologist made an appointment for May 1 to address the related issues I am having if I get a good PSA.
1> Incontinence. I did not get lucky on this. I leak 100-200ml/day. Has not really gotten any better. I am ready to do something about it. Has anyone had any history with the sling or the AUS?
He also mentioned the collagen injections.
2> Impotence. I get a half mast erection, not strong enough for penetration.
Am taking Cialis 10mg every other day. I didn't care for the pump and am
willing to try the injections.
My urologist also mentioned for me to consider the double surgery: the penile implant and the AUS but I thought I would wait a while on the implant as
it may not have had time to heal on the ED front.

Thanks for your thoughts.

I would definitely hang fire on implants at the moment. 11 months post surgery is not long especially if your getting some kind of erection. Keep with the cialis and try a stronger dose every now and again, also try Viagra and levitra. They both work slightly differently.
Surprised you've not already tried injections, as Brave says they work in 5 mins. Getting the correct dosage was tricky but have done at least 40 injections in last 6 months.
Having said all that and done all that my erections have only just started naturally after @ 7 months. I'm now 9 months post RALPH. Probably at half mast and not enough for natural penetration.

Question, if you don't mind, I am curious when you take a piss, can stop your pee mid stream? Not sure this matters, but it is my own scientific mind thinking that the more you do this you develop muscle memory (really brain reflex memory) to do this when you leak. Again, unscientific, but this is what I did pre/post surgery instead of doing kegals.

On the ED front, definitely go for the injections, IMHO. There is BiMix, TriMix and QuadMix (2-4 different mix of drugs). Your doctor will pick one of them and the ratio of the mix based on what he thinks will work the best. Most popular is TriMix, but I am on BiMix and it works great. Also, you may want to try the VED pump. Between the injections and the pump my spontaneous erections definitely improved.

encouragement. My journey with PC has really been made easier with guys like
you who are willing to share and encourage both.

On the leakage front, I am able to stop in midstream. My urologist actually told me
not to do too much of that because of some damage (I can't recall exactly what)
that it might cause. It certainly is a good way to determine if you are using the
correct muscles and I have done that.

I leak primarily with activity whether its 100-120 cc when I do my daily 4 mile walk or golfing or yard work. My urologist
has me doing 4 times daily a set of 10 quick contractions, 10 slow contractions to the count of 10, then 10 quick contractions daily. I know there are other recommendations on the frequency, etc. I am pretty dedicated with this.
Kept up with the leakage with a food scale for 3 months and then stopped.

I am starting back again and there is not much change. I need this info to give to
my urologist. He told me if the incontinence didn't go away after a year, that
it probably wouldn't. Obviously Chuck has some different information.
I will definitely try the injections for ED.

It is hard to know what to do. I am going to retire in May and would like to
solve some of these issues.

The first and most important is the PSA next Monday.

I've never had the nerve to try and stop my urine flow -- I'm afraid I'll hurt myself, but my doctor at Mayo says that I will not. Perhaps, in your case, the doctor says this because you're still less than a year from the surgery?

As for the Kegels, I would suggest that you follow your doctor's orders. But, if it does not improve, try it the Mayo way and see if it helps.

No, it doesn't work that way. The chance of hitting the cancer depends mostly on the percentage of prostate that contains cancer. For example, if the tumor is 10% of the prostate, then a single core has around 10% chance (actually a little more because the core has length vs being a single point) of hitting tumor or about a 90% chance of missing. But a 2nd core has another more-or-less independent 10% chance of hitting the cancer. For cancer involving 10% of the prostate the chances of all 12 cores missing tumor (false negative) would be 0.9 ^12 = 28% or about a 72% chance of finding it.";"Last edited by njs; 10-29-2013 at 02:40 AM.

Solid explanation njs. In regards to why not get if you on AS. Biopsy are somewhat uncomfortable (I remember the 12 spring loaded snaps) and they have complications sometime. I would get it if the Doctor felt it needed. In regards to ins, more people getting biopsies mean higher premiums for all.
I do have a question, of my 12 biopsies, the positives were only on one side. This was a good thing as it suggested the tumor may have not spread/been aggressive. Of the 6 biopsies on the left, 3 were positive. I asked the urologist, were those positive from adjacent biopsies. He said it does not matter. I call BS on that. If you have 3 of 6 positive samples, and the positive 3 are together is better than if they are spread out.

Njs; I understand your calculation, but I'm still not satisfied. I think the volume of tissue must be a factor ( in your model, it is not). Surely twelve cores that remove, say 20% of the prostate would have a better chance of finding cancer than 12 cores that take only 0.1%.

I'm wondering how much tissue a pathologist needs to examine, in practice, in order to make a Gleason grade. It can't be just ""points"".

I think njs is pretty spot on. biopsy that removes 20 percent would need to use a massive needle, huge chance of peritonitis etc. And it is more like points I think. When you are biopsied, the pathologist looks at slides from the biopsy. I do not think he examines the whole biopsy but a few slides per biopsy. So if that is true, the volume of the biopsy is not that important. I think each slide is about 5 micron thick, 0.000196850393701 of an inch. In other words, they are only looking at a small volume from each biopsy. more biopsies will improve the odds, bigger biopsies likely would not. it is all about trying to find what may be a needle in a haystack at a reasonable cost.";"Last edited by bigbrad2008; 10-29-2013 at 03:42 PM.";"bigbrad2008";"http://www.cancerforums.net/members/106810-bigbrad2008";"";"Senior User";"Dec 2011";"Huntsville, Al";"120"
"10-29-2013";" 03:47 PM";"njs has stated it correctly. The numbers vary a little because the size of the prostrate varies along with the size of the tumor(s). A biopsy needle is typically 18ga or .084cm in diameter (inside) and the depth of the biopsy is typically 1cm. So the sample taken is .084 x 1. Someone correct me if I am wrong, but I believe most tumors are on the outside of the prostrate. Therefore the depth can be used to get the height of the tumor. So in reality, it is only surface area that matters in determining the chance of a biopsy finding cancer.

If you assume a 3cm x 3cm x 4cm (width x height x length) prostrate size and a 1cm diameter tumor than a 12 needle biopsy has a 44% chance of finding cancer. If you do a 40 needle saturation biopsy than the chance goes up to 86%.

An analogy is trying to find the chance of rolling a number on a dice when you roll it 12 times. In this case the dice would have about 20 sides (1/20th of the prostate has cancer).

The 1/1000 stats I believe refer to the amount of area being sampled. Using the size mentioned above, than a 12 needle biopsy samples 4/1000 (or .4%) of the surface of the prostrate (it also samples .7% of the volume).

Hope this was not to techy, but wanted to add some detail to the answer njs gave. For those that want to play with the number themselves than I would recommend you download a free app called specQ and copy and past the below into that calculator and press F5.

As the famous quote goes, ""all models are wrong, but some are useful"". Mine is a simple 1st order approximation that is conservative in the sense that it over estimates the probability of missing the tumor. You are right that probability of missing the tumor goes down as the volume of the sample goes up, but in practice the volume of the core is small compared to the volume of the tumor so the latter should dominate.

As I understand it, the slide that the pathologist examines is an axial section along the length of the core (which is why the amount of cancer found is expressed as mm of tumor or as percent of core length that is tumor. So a greater core volume would not really be a benefit but the fact that the core has length definitely is a benefit vs. a theoretical point sample. However the extent of the benefit is somewhat limited because the additional tissue sampled along the length of a single core is spatially correlated (as is the tissue in the tumor).

As I recently posted in another thread the following regarding 10, 12, and 14 core biopsies as well as discussion of saturation biopsies in the article

See ""#6. The Role and Limitations of Saturation Biopsies""

http://www.hindawi.com/journals/pc/2011/386207/

The below section is referring to initial biopsies as well as follow up biopsies when a saturation biopsy is not called for.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2006, Eichler and colleagues published a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies with a total of 20,698 patients. Data was pooled from 68 studies comparing a total of 94 extended schemes with the sextant standard, demonstrating once more that laterally directed cores significantly increase the diagnostic yield. In particular, 12-core with additional laterally directed cores detected 31% more cancers than the sextant scheme, with a comparable complication rate. Interestingly, no further benefit was seen in extended schemes with 18 to 24 cores, whereas the adverse event profile was poor with these templates. The authors concluded that more than 12 cores added no significant benefit [29].

In agreement with Eichlerâ€™s meta-analysis, two recently published studies critically reviewing the optimal biopsy strategies have further supported the use of extended 10- to 14-core biopsy schemes as the new â€œgold standardâ€ for first-time prostate biopsy [30, 31].

http://www.europeanurology.com/artic...104-8/abstract - Saturation biopsy scheme showed a significant advantage in prostate cancer (PCa) detection over an extended scheme. In addition, subgroup analyses found a saturation protocol to be superior to an extended protocol in the detection of PCa in men with PSA <10 ng/ml.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23714648:
Modified TTSB (modified transperineal template-guided saturation biopsy) has a high cancer yield, especially in the anterior region, in patients with previously negative histology but onward suspicion of PCa. The modified TTSB technique provides a low risk of AUR without compromising cancer yield.

So, IMO, the jury is still out. Like the radiation-vs-surgery debate, hopefully in 10 or 15 years we'll have clear data.

Of course, this should only be taken as another piece of data. Some, like me, are very ""left-brained"" and NEED to understand the numbers as part of the decision-making or dealing-with-it process.

In particular, 12-core with additional laterally directed cores detected 31% more cancers than the sextant scheme, with a comparable complication rate. Interestingly, no further benefit was seen in extended schemes with 18 to 24 cores, whereas the adverse event profile was poor with these templates. The authors concluded that more than 12 cores added no significant benefit [29].

I think njs is pretty spot on. biopsy that removes 20 percent would need to use a massive needle, huge chance of peritonitis etc. And it is more like points I think. When you are biopsied, the pathologist looks at slides from the biopsy. I do not think he examines the whole biopsy but a few slides per biopsy. So if that is true, the volume of the biopsy is not that important. I think each slide is about 5 micron thick, 0.000196850393701 of an inch. In other words, they are only looking at a small volume from each biopsy. more biopsies will improve the odds, bigger biopsies likely would not. it is all about trying to find what may be a needle in a haystack at a reasonable cost.";"Last edited by bigbrad2008; 10-29-2013 at 03:42 PM.";"bigbrad2008";"http://www.cancerforums.net/members/106810-bigbrad2008";"";"Senior User";"Dec 2011";"Huntsville, Al";"120"
"10-29-2013";" 03:47 PM";"njs has stated it correctly. The numbers vary a little because the size of the prostrate varies along with the size of the tumor(s). A biopsy needle is typically 18ga or .084cm in diameter (inside) and the depth of the biopsy is typically 1cm. So the sample taken is .084 x 1. Someone correct me if I am wrong, but I believe most tumors are on the outside of the prostrate. Therefore the depth can be used to get the height of the tumor. So in reality, it is only surface area that matters in determining the chance of a biopsy finding cancer.

If you assume a 3cm x 3cm x 4cm (width x height x length) prostrate size and a 1cm diameter tumor than a 12 needle biopsy has a 44% chance of finding cancer. If you do a 40 needle saturation biopsy than the chance goes up to 86%.

An analogy is trying to find the chance of rolling a number on a dice when you roll it 12 times. In this case the dice would have about 20 sides (1/20th of the prostate has cancer).

The 1/1000 stats I believe refer to the amount of area being sampled. Using the size mentioned above, than a 12 needle biopsy samples 4/1000 (or .4%) of the surface of the prostrate (it also samples .7% of the volume).

Hope this was not to techy, but wanted to add some detail to the answer njs gave. For those that want to play with the number themselves than I would recommend you download a free app called specQ and copy and past the below into that calculator and press F5.

(Disclosure; I'm an engineer, with a math hobby, so this is burning my curiosity)

As the famous quote goes, ""all models are wrong, but some are useful"". Mine is a simple 1st order approximation that is conservative in the sense that it over estimates the probability of missing the tumor. You are right that probability of missing the tumor goes down as the volume of the sample goes up, but in practice the volume of the core is small compared to the volume of the tumor so the latter should dominate.

As I understand it, the slide that the pathologist examines is an axial section along the length of the core (which is why the amount of cancer found is expressed as mm of tumor or as percent of core length that is tumor. So a greater core volume would not really be a benefit but the fact that the core has length definitely is a benefit vs. a theoretical point sample. However the extent of the benefit is somewhat limited because the additional tissue sampled along the length of a single core is spatially correlated (as is the tissue in the tumor). I know that is qualitative and imprecise, but hopefully it gives some sense of the validity and limitations of the simple 1st order approximation above.";"Jan '13: PSA 1.23, small nodule on DRE (1st screening @ age 40)

Today is my twelfth day post surgery (DaVinci robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy) and my first day back at work (no lifting, lite-duty). I am doing absolutely fantastic! The surgery was done by Dr. Clayton S. Lau at City of Hope in Duarte, CA on October 8th, beginning at 1pm. I was out of surgery by 4pm and on my feet by 7pm, walking the ward (this is very important to recovery). They kept offering me IV pain meds and I kept refusing them about half the time, just enough to keep me comfortable without over-doing it. I kept walking about every hour to two hours until I was discharged at about noon the following day.

I went home with 10mg Percocet and a catheter, but only used three of them the entire time (one the first evening and then two the following day). After that I used Tylenol for a couple of days and I was done with the pain meds. I kept exercising (short walks) several times a day, and was hating the catheter! That thing is REALLY uncomfortable...

My first follow-up visit was on the 14th, six days (barely) post surgery. I drove myself out there and got the catheter removed (WHEW! what a relief) painlessly (it slides right out after it is deflated). Since I had been doing Kegels since a couple of weeks prior to surgery I was able to immediately stop the urine flow twice during my voiding test during the catheter removal. They also discussed my pathology results and gave me an ""all-clear"", the results had come back Gleason's 3+3=6 and there had been no cancer outside the prostate capsule (they had also removed 9 lymph nodes, to be sure).

My recovery at home has been very unremarkable, other than the minor leakage. The Depend Guards have taken care of minor leakage and have allowed me to make regular outings. The leakage seems to be tapering off a little bit. They say that continence returns first to the over-night time frame, then to the mornings, and finally to the evenings. My girlfriend managed to coax a very minor erection over the weekend, so I'm looking forward to improvement in that category and in the continence category.

If anybody has any questions I can answer please feel free to ask. I will certainly make my best effort, or I will tell you if I do not know or have doubts. There is a lot of very helpful information on this board and especially from those that have gone before us and who are willing to share their experiences.

Welcome to ""this"" side of the operating room! And glad you are doing so well.

Your recovery, so far, sounds almost identical to mine. Never had any pain.

The only thing is that I did not find the catheter uncomfortable -- took advantage of its presence by drinking by the gallon in the knowledge that I would not have to get up and go to the bathroom all the time. LOL Also painless when it was removed.

The ONLY thing I would caution you on is the sexual part. Having your gf coax things a bit is probably fine. But actual sex is not recommended until about 3 weeks after surgery. But it's still good to know that the mechanics are still working and ready to go after you've hit that 3rd week.

Good luck!

Thank you Chuck, but the doc actually encouraged masturbation and light sexual play, as tolerated. He said that encouraging the circulation is a great thing, but be sure not to strain myself. The erection was not sufficient for penetration, but it was definitely encouraging.

Honorable mention goes out to any survivor's partner willing to be patient and encourage the rehabilitation process.

Had a bumpy road and came home today after 6 days in hospital. Surgery went well, no issues with bladder spasm and in the wake-up I felt fine, sigh leakage from the catheter but a young nurse rapidly washed my boys and I was fine. The surgen spared the nerves on one side and partly on the other side but given the size of the tumor he was happy. There was a small leak in the suture so I had to have a drain in place. The most remarkable memory was the handwritten note taped on the daVinci robot saying ""Do not unplug, batteries will drain!"" (True!)

However the drain added one day in hospital to check that leakage stopped. But then came the hard part, I bloated severely, my digestive system shut down.
Day three I looked pregnant and started vomiting and where given morphine against the pain in the bladder area where gas probably pressed the bruised areas. The drain was removed which did not hurt but felt straight unnatural.
Day four a minor fart and more vomiting. Nurses actually at one point said ""we can see that you are in such pain that you should take more morphine"". No BM but clear fluid. I did walk around as much as possible, I did take laxatives.
Day five monumental fart happened after actual doing toe-touches in bathroom and pain stopped however the doctors said that evenso the swelling was so big that if it did not go down I would need an x-ray of my abdomen. However on day five things continued to get out of me and in the evening yesterday I could eat and basically feel ok. Then I also realized that the pain from the surgery as such was very minor.
And day six I was released.

I recognize the stomach issues from my hip replacement and I believe that this is a side effect of surgery that now and then can happen but with a prostate removal you worry more because the pain is in the same area.

So here I sit and watch TV with a bag at my leg and a pregnant stomach but feeling ok.";"Born in 1962

They will start testing PSA in 2-3 months, that will be nervous...

All in all I am happy, if my stomach was normal I would take a walk outside in the -10C and snow but I am actually concerned I would soil myself...and I do not need more humiliation right now.

Since they saved about 75% of my nerves I also got a prescription of 85 Cialis doses which feels fine, I realize there are no guarantees but still.

They will start testing PSA in 2-3 months, that will be nervous...

All in all I am happy, if my stomach was normal I would take a walk outside in the -10C and snow but I am actually concerned I would soil myself...and I do not need more humiliation right now.

One weird thing that has occurred is that I am still very emotional, when my relatives called in the hospital I almost cried in the phone and I actually had to ask my wife to explain to my daughters that I am fine just emotional.

Normally this little combo would have made me pass everything (including my spine) in two hours. Catheter is not bad at all, it is a hassle but also convenient not to have to get up early in the morning. My wife insisted on looking at it yesterday.....

Since they saved about 75% of my nerves I also got a prescription of 85 Cialis doses which feels fine, I realize there are no guarantees but still.

They will start testing PSA in 2-3 months, that will be nervous...

All in all I am happy, if my stomach was normal I would take a walk outside in the -10C and snow but I am actually concerned I would soil myself...and I do not need more humiliation right now.

One weird thing that has occurred is that I am still very emotional, when my relatives called in the hospital I almost cried in the phone and I actually had to ask my wife to explain to my daughters that I am fine just emotional. No problems at all talking to the care staff. I donÂ´t know but I guess that cancer, even when removed, changes your mind a little bit also.";"Born in 1962

I don't know where or how many tumors I have now (the iliac lymph nodes were involved) but the symptoms thing is a strange deal. I'm not sure I can blame any of my current symptoms on my cancer, although, maybe all of my symptoms are from the PCa.

I was having pain in the right groin for over a year PSA in 2011 Sept. was 2.4 a year later it is 17. I have had difficulty sleeping on the right side for 2-3 years before this lump appeared, (inguinal) in July. I have been walking a lot over the past year to exercise and had lost 60 lbs. gained over last hormone therapy regime. In August the lump in my groin was same but hurt like the dickens. My abdomen would throb and that lump felt like a knife whenever I had to push while sitting on the pot. While walking i noticed that my right leg felt weak and often coming out of the shower I would stub my foot on the stall. I had strange bouts with pain in the penis shaft, mid back, testicles. I started sitting with my hand cupping myself just to nurse the pain. Was sleeping a great deal to escape pain. This is the first time in 3 times that I have looked forward to having hormone therapy. Oh and I also noticed that my arthritis is better when on hormone therapy.

When the first PSA was zero and I asked him about returning in 6 months, he cheerfully said, ""How about 9 months?"" I actually went back in 7 months since we have annual physicals there every September. When that test was also zero, he said I only needed to return once a year during my annual physical.

I did have a very small positive margin, but he said this is statistically insignificant. He said all of the numbers are strongly in my favor regarding the possibility of any recurrence. I did not even need any follow-up treatment after the DaVinci.

The morning after the surgery, he told me, ""I really think you can consider yourself cured.""

Soooooooo, I guess I'm rolling the dice a bit that he is correct and that there is almost no chance of any further problems. I agree with you, though, about the anxiety of my next PSA, which will be one year after the previous one. He is one of the top urologists at Mayo Clinic, so I have placed my total trust in him.

Hopefully, that trust will be proven well placed as time goes on.

"01-24-2013";" 06:10 AM";"Hi,

Did you remove the catheter by yourself? If so, did the doctor give you the go-ahead? I guess some patients I've heard of have removed their own catheter, but the vast majority of times it is removed by the doctor or a nurse. They do this after examining the color of the collected urine to determine if the healing is complete enough.

Yeah, it usually takes just a week or so to get the post-op pathology. I found out the official report at Mayo a week after surgery when the catheter was removed, but I had also been given a preliminary pathology report (verbal) by the doctor the morning after surgery.

Anyway, I did not feel any burning upon my first urination. But I was stunned at the tremendous force of the stream because, prior to the surgery, I was only dribbling because of severe BPH. Naturally I was very pleased at this.

Good luck on the PSA test. Did you have nerve sparing surgery? If so, the erections should eventually return on their own, although it can take anywhere from a couple months to several years.

The doctor could give you a prescription of Cialis or Viagra to enrich bloodflow to the surgical area, which will promote faster healing.

PT3a (ECE present and focal margins).
Gleason 7 (3x4)
Pre-surgery PSA was 3.78

Surgeon who performed RRP felt very confident that what post-surgical pathology was detecting on the specimen were simple ""surgical artifacts"" -- he felt confident that surgery was successful.

Given that the RRP was performed in a top NYC hospital and by a leading surgeon I shared his optimism. Now, however, I am experiencing anxiety over this 3x rise in 6-months (rounded .06 = .1).

Here are my questions (meeting with my urologist this week to discuss):

What is this forum's opinion of movement from .02 to .06?

The recent PSA test was taken in the afternoon and all others have been taken in the morning. Would having test performed later in day impact results?

I am prepared from surgeon to recommend that I take repeat test in 3 months or so, but this 6-month increase in PSA has me a bit freaked-out and with ECE and focal is time my ""friend.""

"11-02-2016";" 10:03 AM";"Guys:
Looking for some input on what went wrong with my surgery. I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in early 2015, T2c, Gleason 3+4. I was 52 years old, exceptional shape, biking over 7000 miles a year and no other known health issues. I had a robotic prostatectomy in July of 2015 with an extremely skilled surgeon outside of New York City. I was supposed to be the ideal candidate. Nerve sparing surgery with all nerve bundles saved. Everything was confined to the capsule, and subsequent PSA testing is 0.1 each time. Doctor says I am in the clear.

Here is the problem. Since the surgery, I am completely impotent. Nothing, no nocturnal movement, not even a whisper. I tried all of the drugs, with no movement in the slightest. I am also incontinent, leaking about 3 to 5 ounces, by weight of urine every 24 hours. I did 6 months of PT with an excellent therapist, which helped with the leaking marginally. Interestingly, I do not leak at night, only during the day and with certain activities.

The only way I can have sex is using a product called Erektor, combined with a vacuum pump. Results are just passable, nothing more. i am seeing my urologist next week for a cystoscopy, urodynamics and a nerve conduction study. My question is first, what went wrong, and at this point what can I do to fix it? Is there any additional testing that should be done at this point? I love my uro and my surgeon, and both are stumped.

With nerve-sparing surgery it can take some time but after a year I would guess that some small sign of life should come back. And same on leakage. But I am only a guy no expert, having a surgeon that you trust is very important and if you together can for a plan of action that is really valuable.

But also we are all different and for some guys it takes longer to heal. I spoke to a guy who had surgery about five years ago and he still think that things are improving for every day.

I can really feel your pain but donÂ´t give up, it will improve, and you are cancer free!

Sorry to hear you are still having problems in those two areas. Probably only your surgeon can honestly tell you what the problem might be.

And, do not rule out the possibility that there really may NOT be a problem.

Sometimes it just takes a long time. I have heard of patients who took well over a year to recover their continence.

And, in some cases, it can take several years for erections to return. A few years ago we had a member (no pun intended) report that he had long ago given up on the return of his erections. Then, with NO advance hints, he suddenly got a very hard erection one morning. He dismissed it as a fluke.

But then, another erection formed a day or so later. Then, all of a sudden, he was able to get erect as before surgery -- with NO hint of any erections in the time since the surgery.

The uplifting thing about this story is that these erections returned almost FOUR YEARS after his surgery. The nerves suddenly decided to wake up and reactivate and his normal sexual function was back.

So, do not give up hope since you are still 16 months from surgery. Your erections should have returned by now -- but there is no written timetable. Every patient is different and it CAN take years for the magic to return.

Hopefully this will be the case with you and that normal functioning is still in your future.

First, are you still riding that much?
Second, have you discussed with your doctor whether the bike riding could be related to your problem?
Third, even with Michael's excellent suggestion, I just don't see (with road hazards and potholes and that many miles) how you can avoid taking a beating to an area that should not be taking a beating.

I had just about the lowest form of prostate cancer that anyone would even do anything about. I opted for LDR/HDR which ended in May 2015. The treatments went well with some negative affects from the radiation, but not nearly as bad as my imagination thought it could be.

But since then there hasnâ€™t been one day where I did not have a burning sensation when I pee. I have been on Tamsulosin since the treatments began. I tried to stop taking them for a few days and my stream went from medium to weakâ€¦so Iâ€™m back. I tried UTA and except for the pretty color, they did not have much effect.

After a 4 month fight with my insurance company, I was actually able to get a daily 5mg does of Cialis. That helped some, but not completely. Helped a little in the bedroom as well, but far from completely. Iâ€™ve been on Cialis for 6 months.

My radiologist has put me on a 3 month regiment of Pentoxifylline, Indomethacin, and vitamin E. Iâ€™m about half way through and it has helped, but again, not all the way.

As expected, the initial PSA results dropped tremendously, to the 1.2 area. It went down to 1.08 but my last one had a slight uptickâ€¦which my urologist says is not unexpected. I am currently waiting on the latest results.

Neither my Urologist or Radiologist are too concerned with my current condition, but I am. My Urologist is suggesting that if the drugs do not help, he can perform a Cystoscopy with a possible dilation.

Am I ever going to urinate normally? Will my sex life (currently rated in the 1-2 out of 10 range) get better?

I also have an odd sensation in my groin. To be tacky, it is best described as â€œblue ballsâ€. Ejaculation does not help. This started about 3 weeks ago.

Any help would be appreciated.

Welcome to the forum. Can you give us your biopsy stats and also your PSA history? Having things like your Gleason scores, number of positive biopsy cores, staging, etc., will help give us a more complete picture of your situation.

My experience is not in the radiation treatment area, but the symptoms you're describing sound like pretty normal side effects.

Let's stay tuned as people, who also had radiation as their primary treatment, jump in with their thoughts & experiences. Things tend to be slower on weekends, but you should be flooded with help over the next couple of days.

Chances are that it is just a settling of the PSA numbers on a micro basis. With your pathology report, of course, the doctor will probably want to keep checking the PSA on a regular basis.

Two questions:

1. Were they done by the same lab on the same machine. If not, there could be machine differences.

2. Were there < signs before any of the numbers? If there are no < before the .03 and the machine's resolution is .01, yes you need to worry and prepare for just in case.

My suggestion is to retest in a month or two and see if the PSA settles down or continue to increase.

We welcome you to the forum, David, with hopes that we can also reject any application to join the ""prostate cancer club.""

As the others have indicated, such a high PSA is a serious thing that must be investigated by a good urologist.

Can you give us more details, such as your age and your history of previous PSA scores, including the dates? This will help us have a better idea of what might be happening.

In the meantime, you hopefully have a doctor's appointment scheduled so it can be checked out???

Good luck,

-The first few bowel movement's and the accompanying bladder spasms are a real eye opener but with stool softeners,fiber and patience they will diminish in intensity with each one

Hi there,

Just wanted to welcome you to the forum. Equally happy to hear of your great success with the surgery. The surgery cure rate is the same whether it is open or robotic, so you should be just fine.

Thanks for the advice you offered via your experience. It will be very helpful to those just taking their first steps down this road.

Good luck!

I did ask my surgeon about the rocco stitch before the surgery and he felt that the technique increased the risk of leaving cancer behind.I will ask him why my level of continence is as good as it seems. I know all about back pain as before the surgery I went to see my physio for some nagging back pain.It helped but I must say that with the amount of manipulation during the surgery and the postage size hospital beds my back was almost as painful as the bloating.";"";"Greatwhitenorth";"http://www.cancerforums.net/members/108489-Greatwhitenorth";"";"Regular User";"Dec 2013";"Vancouver B.C.";"10"

Any thoughts about switching to ultrasensitive PSA testing (uPSA) if not already doing so? uPSA can detect a ""rising"" PSA sooner than standard PSA. Thus intervention can take place sooner. If you are at risk for recurrence, discuss with your Oncologist uPSA testing every 4 months for the next couple of years.

Good luck! Hoping that your PSA remains permanently below the radar screen!";"PSA: Oct '09 = 1.91, Oct '11 = 2.79, Dec '11 = 2.98 (PSA, Free = 0.39ng/ml, % PSA Free = 13%)

Welcome to the forum -- with a very high probability that you won't have to join the PC Club. It is EXTREMELY rare for an 18 year-old to have prostate cancer.

There is no absolute normal for PSA readings, but generally anything under 4.0 is considered normal for a man in his 50s. Anything under 3.0 is considered normal for anyone in their 40s or younger. In your case, this could simply be your normal PSA. It is also possible that there is a urinary tract infection, etc., that is causing you to hit the toilet so often and giving you that particular PSA number.

Having a 0.8 reading at age 18 is probably due to other things instead of PC. Here are a few links that I found on Google for you to check out:

The second link is info from Mayo Clinic showing SEVEN NON-cancerous reasons for having elevated PSA numbers.

Hang in as others will be coming along with their own thoughts & advice.

In any event, I'm sure you are going to be just fine.

Thanks so much for the reply Chuck! Yeah I don't think I have cancer, it's got to be chronic prostatitis!! I have all the symptoms but they won't take me seriously because of my anxiety.

"08-18-2013";" 08:53 PM";"Greetings,

I am 19 days post-op from DaVinci surgery having had the operation on July 30th. I had the catheter removed on August 5th.

I am fortunate in that I have been dry since the day following the removal of the catheter. I have good control over holding back my urine even when my bladder is full but finding a bathroom when it's really full is of course essential. I drink lots of water during the day which is something I always did and trips to the bathroom to let it out haven't increased.

I seem to have recovered quickly and returned to work this past Monday (August 12th). I have limited physical activities and won't be returning to bike riding until late September. I went for a short run on the treadmill this past Thursday (August 15th) and felt fine. I then went for a two mile run with my daughter yesterday and that went fine but I will still need to ease back into any distances.

I have been able to achieve erections with manual stimulation and getting anywhere near my wife elicited similar responses but I knew that the real test would be trying to have intercourse.

Last night we tried things out and it was as it always has been in terms of arousal, stiffness, duration and so forth. The one thing I have noticed is that the orgasm isn't as fulfilling in that the buildup to climax is less intense. I certainly don't want to complain as I am happy that everything is working.

I still have to be careful when sitting on hard surfaces and I will avoid any heavy lifting for the next several weeks. Otherwise I feel about as close to my pre-surgery self as possible given the circumstances. I am truly blessed and hope that my progress continues.

For those that continue to improve and manage the side effects of surgery I hope that your recovery moves swiftly. For those just starting out on their journey please know that there is hope of a quick and relatively unimpaired recovery.

Thanks to all that have shared their stories.

Greetings,

JustSlappy, Initially I did briefly consider AS, followed by radiation. The deciding factors for me were my Gleason score of 7 (3+4) which really isn't ""very non-aggressive"" and with my presentation the greatest chance for cure was surgery. I looked at radiation as more of a ""remedy"" that could leave open the possibility for re-occurrence not to mention other longer time issues especially given my age. That isn't to suggest that either treatment is wrong for anyone else however that is how I looked at it. For me removal of the prostate and therefore the cancer gave me the best shot at putting this completely behind me.

I see my surgeon tomorrow for my fist visit and figure ill be getting things removed in october. I hope i can follow your lead !
gsteve, best of luck tomorrow and I hope you are as happy with your first visit to your surgeon as I was with mine. We were VERY impressed with him and immediately felt confident and assured. THAT is an important component going into this. I hope you follow my lead as well and wish you all the very best.

Greetings,

ddayglo, I know what you mean as I had zero symptoms as well. My PSA was normal one year and jumped up the next. Peeing was never really an issue although I had begun noticing that my stream wasn't as forceful as it once was. This was even more apparent when I would occasionally hear my 19 year old son pee as it sounded like a firehouse. Now you can't distinguish between the two of us..

Needless to say I was embarrassed and very noticeable in my shorts. From day 1 after cath removed had dry nights, urge would wake me up, only had minimal leakage during the day for a couple of weeks.

Now this has started up worse than the beginning of my journey another problem has sprung up.

When I take a Viagra and start getting aroused I start squirting urine also. To say this kills the mood is under statement, still do the Keges when I think about, not just every day. Started back doing them every day, maybe this is for life now.

Even after emptying my bladder if my wife tugs on it, it is like she is milking a cow. I don't drink coffee and limit myself to 1 12 ounce soda a day usually at lunch. Almond milk in the morning or regular 2% and water at dinner or occasionally tea.

Cut out drinking beer mainly because I started back in end of April riding a motorcycle. See my Urologist this coming Tuesday for my 3 month psa check up.

I just don't understand what caused this to startup, could it have to do with nerve sparring. By the way, I turned 66 the 4th of this month, great present I have gotten.

Can you refresh us on your original biopsy stats and your post-op pathology report? This will help us get a better idea of what might be going on.

It does seem unusual that squrting urine, so far out from the surgery, would begin happening -- unless it is a side effect from the salvage radiation.

One critical thing that Mayo Clinic stresses is that we prostatectomy patients must NOT ever stop doing those Kegels. We must do them for the rest of our lives. Fortunately, Mayo recommends doing just one set per day (see the sticky on this) for a grand total of 7 reps.

They advise not to do more than this and they further advise that it does not hurt to miss a day from time to time. But generally they must be done almost every day to keep the muscle strong as we age. So start doing this and see if it doesn't improve the situation in a short span of time.

Then perhaps you'll be able to return that gift and keep it from giving again.

Your uro might have other ideas as well, so please let us know what happens there.

Good luck!

"10-10-2015";" 04:01 AM";"My non professional guess is similar to what Highlander suspected: Could be delayed side effects of salvage radiation. It is a well known but seldom mentioned consequence of radiation treatment: Initial side effects are minimal but for some people they show up long after treatment is over, up to five years later. This is contrary to surgery where side effects, if any, are immediate but for many people they diminish as time passes.

You may have to adjust and retrain your system, just like right after surgery. Highlander gave you very good advice and perhaps you should try them.

"05-30-2016";" 03:24 AM";"Welcome to the forum, Chester,

I would not worry too much about having a recurrence of the cancer. I suspect that most doctors would NOT have done SRT in your case because, as far as I can see, you do NOT appear to have had any recurrence and the SRT hopefully was done needlessly (meaning that I'm correct that you do NOT have a recurrence).

With a post-op PSA of 0.23, your PSA reading was actually ZERO. Recurrence is not suspected until there are 2 or 3 consecutive readings of 0.1 or higher. And your readings are nowhere close to that. Your readings are actually very good.

I suspect that your doctor jumped the gun on this because of the two positive margins. But Gleasons 3+3 and 3+4 are considered low risk and not likely to cause any problems unless the secondary Gleason 4 grade was involved in the margins. And your PSA gives no real indication of this being the case.

So, as Fairwind suggested, enjoy your summer.";"July 2011 local PSA lab reading 6.41 (from 4.1 in 2009). Mayo Clinic PSA 9/ 2011 = 5.7.

My uro and RO indicated that a BCR was likely inevitable. And it seems to be currently unaffected by the SRT. There could be a delayed reaction to the SRT, or the PSA could remain stable, which would be fine with me. In any case, at this point it seems the SRT may have been done needlessly. The whole SRT process was uneventful, no SE's (yet), so I have no regrets, other than the $5,400 deductible for the year. I suspect I'll be scheduling as many scans, tests and procedures as I can get in before the end of the year. But I do intend to try and enjoy my summer.

I agree that there probably is no reason to have regrets about the SRT, aside from the money spent. The treatments are not likely to cause any major problems down the road. And, who knows? They may very well have knocked out any possible BCR.

As for the PSA, my understanding is that there ARE some parts of the body that produce extremely tiny amounts of PSA. This is why there are readings at the ultra sensitive level -- and these tiny readings do go up and down and are meaningless.

Mayo Clinic does not use the ultrasensitive test for that reason -- too much unnecessary anxiety can be caused.";"July 2011 local PSA lab reading 6.41 (from 4.1 in 2009). Mayo Clinic PSA 9/ 2011 = 5.7.

"05-31-2016";" 03:06 PM";"Hi Chester! I'm certain others who have undergone RP followed by SR will shed guiding light.

Following standard radiation as initial treatment for PC, it can take several years to reach a nadir PSA. I'm not sure of the timeline to reach a PSA nadir following SR, but guessing that it is likely at least 12 - 24 months. Therefore I strongly doubt that you should be concerned with SR failure at this time! As long as your PSA is not rising, you should not even think about recurrence.

Your post op month 19 PSA of 0.023 was not definitive if BR. Was it possibly 0.23 - as Highlander points out? It should have been followed by a confirmatory PSA prior to initiation of SR - IMO.

Moving forward, be absolutely certain to follow your PSA at The Same Lab using The Same PSA Assay each time. This is the only way that uPSA results can be compared.

Finally, for some great encouragement, take a look at Jim215's signature. His is a textbook example of BR following RP and then SR. Looks almost too perfect! (On a side note: Jim is a little bit crotchety and will tell it like it is. Also, NEVER, get into a card game with Jim - unless you like loosing! We remain most fortunate to have Jim as a PC Forum Brother!)

Stay calm & optimistic!

Everything I've seen seems to indicate a bigger drop after 3 months. All I can do is wait now. My PSA at 19 months was .023 prior to SRT. I would've thought it would be .01 or less afterwards. But, if it remains the same or lower in August I'll be relieved. I do have my uPSA tested with the same lab. Both the uro and RO suggested the same.

So many of you helped provide support when I reached out just after my 66-year old husband's surgery in April. He has made a great recovery -- almost completely back to his normal, pre-surgery self.

He just got the results of his first PSA, and the nurse read it to him over the phone = 0.3. He went to his primary care doc here in Virginia for the blood test, because he had the surgery at Hopkins in MD but we live in Virginia. We haven't had a chance to discuss the lab results with the surgeon yet, so perhaps I am ""troubling trouble.""

In anyone's experience, does a 0.3 PSA post surgery mean he needs radiation immediately, or do we wait another 2 or 3 months for another PSA data point to see if it is going up? Not having seen the actual report, I don't know what kind of test of how many decimal points it reported. If radiation is indicated, what for does it take and where on the body do they ""radiate""? I want to make sure I have good questions to ask the medical professionals the next time we consult.

Thank you all so much.

Before reading lancepeace's response, the first thing that came to mind was the location of the decimal point.
As mentioned, 0.3 is not favorable, but 0.03 is certainly a reasonable number that could continue to go down, go up or stay the same. As long as it remains under 0.1, officially it is considered ""undetectable"" but (with my) caveat that you should keep a close watch on a rising PSA, even if it is ""undetectable"", as evidenced by my own history.
If you have online access to his records via a patient portal, I would want to see the results in written form for confirmation.
In the event that 0.3 is correct, a second PSA test performed at the same location on the same machine would be a logical ""next step"" in order to not do a knee-jerk reaction to a result that may not be accurate. A wait of one to three months might be reasonable before repeating the test.

Item # 1 on your Monday AM ""To Do List"" is to call your local Dr's office and tell them to email, fax, or mail a copy of the PSA result to you. If necessary, drive there and pick up a copy. You need to keep a record of all post op PSA results starting now and moving forward. Since the local MD is a primary care physician, you need to get the PSA results to your surgeon at Hopkins to be entered into your husband's chart. Simply call his Hopkins administrator & ask if they prefer to have each result mailed, faxed or emailed. (Unless of course your Primary MD in VA is already doing this for you - which I doubt).

FYI: I do this drill each time. I call my local Uro who orders the PSA test and I go to the hospital outpatient lab & have the blood drawn and they send it to LabCorp who in turn faxes the result to back to my Primary Uro. I then pick up a copy, keep one for my records and send a copy to my Uro Surgeon in Birmingham, AL. Dr Tully specifically instructed me to send him a copy of each PSA test.

Re the PSA = 0.3: I have a strong visceral sense that the RN misread this result and left out a ""0"" between the . & 3

If in fact it is 0.3, your Primary MD should have had a direct conversation with you about the clinical implications along with specific instructions to notify your MD at Hopkins. Thus my confidence and sincere hope is that the RN made an error.

So, for now, try to forget it and enjoy the remainder of the weekend!

Moving forward, all future PSA tests should be drawn at the same lab and analyzed using the same PSA assay in order to compare results.

Keep us posted. Looking forward to good news on Monday!

Maintain optimism!!!

There is reason for optimism that a zero was slipped, it happen to me.

Let's hope it is .03 but if it is truly a 0.3 then SRT with concurrent HRT sooner than later is likely.
The somewhat iffy pathology report suggested there may have been positive margins. If cells were left behind they could be the source of the .3. It is better to have a local disease that is treatable, and possibly curable, with SRT due to positive margins than to have a systemic disease that has spread to distant places.

Both Creekrat and I each posted radiation logs on this forum in March and updated them weekly through May. Creek's was a primary treatment and mine was SRT with 34 sessions. The good news is with SRT they normally only do HRT for 6 months. A quick read shows that it wasn't a bad experience at all.

Usually slept through the night; on occasion made one trip to pee. ED issues can take from 6 months to 2 years to improve. For a soon to be 67 year-old, I'm very fortunate.

It was not until my seventh month that I was ready for intercourse. That was after a month of using MUSE once a week. My protocol was 20 mg of Cialis three days each week (Tues. Th. & Sat) with 100 mg of Viagra twice each week (Tuesday & Sat). After my 6 month visit, doc said try injections or MUSE. I opted for MUSE. Others here have talked about how helpful the shots are, but figured I would try MUSE first. So once a week for about a month I substituted MUSE for a Viagra. About a month of this led to success. With MUSE you insert a tiny pellet into the penis by using a small applicator.

It is now 14 months post surgery and neither Viagra or Cialis help, however when I went to penile injections (TRIMIX) I was like 22 again. It could be that I was 65 when I had the surgery and so Viagra will take longer or I may always the injections. Actually I'm not bothered by it as the injections work fine and we're back to at least twice a week + I stay hard when vertical or horizontal for an hour.

Dr. said the lymph nodes looked good. Will have the path report back on Mon.

Some discomfort in my stomach which is expected I guess. Hope for good results from the path but am aware that the Gleason score will probably go up & there is a good possibility that it will be found in the lymph nodes & seminal vesicles.

However at this time I am happy to have it out and we will deal with whatever happens.

I believe Chuck is right about the 4+4, if in the core sample just managed to get 4's, then there is no secondary #, so it is assigned another 4 even though if the core sample was a little larger or to the right or left so to speak, they would have found some more 3's. Not a pathologist but it makes sense to me.

It did jump up to a stage T3a because it had left the capsule.

I have finished reading Dr. Walsh's book today. WOW! what an education.

I like his statement on page 376. ""If there is capsular penetration with negative margins, the surgery did the best job any form of treatment could do"". This is in defense of surgery being the gold standard.

I was putting out 1200-2000 ml. per night, I had visions of waking up this morning in a pool. Woke up 3 times during the night, grabbed my dick & squeezed it and went for the bathroom, the end results were, I was dry this morning. The Dr. told my wife yesterday that the 1st couple days would be the worst. Today, I have had a few slight dribbles, but nothing compared to yesterday.

I need to get my 1st PSA test in the middle of Aug. Drs. appointment is the 19th.

I am happy to say that my 1st night without the cath. went far better than expected. Yesterday, every time I moved I would dribble, then when I went to the bathroom, nothing. Since with the cath. I was putting out 1200-2000 ml. per night, I had visions of waking up this morning in a pool. Woke up 3 times during the night, grabbed my dick & squeezed it and went for the bathroom, the end results were, I was dry this morning. The Dr. told my wife yesterday that the 1st couple days would be the worst. Today, I have had a few slight dribbles, but nothing compared to yesterday. Am doing 10 exercise's about once every hr.so results should keep improving.

The days are weird though. I am using a bout 4 Maxi pads a day. But some times when I stand up, after a step or two, it feels like I get these little surges and I feel a little squirt. But if I try to pee, there is very seldom anything there. Is this normal?

I have found that when I am in the prone position, even on my stomach that I don't leak. If I walk at a brisk pace or sit up on a stool like I am right now, I don't feel any leaks at all. It is usually when I am standing still, or start to move.

I have had 1 lap for galbladder prior to da Vinci with no implications. I have not had 2 including a hernia so I can't speak from that experience. I'll simply relay what I heard as I talked with numerous surgeons.

They mentioned adhesions from prior lap surgeries can pose problems and cause them to have to convert to an open procedure. The amount of mesh used for the hernias can play into this too. I also go the impression from some of the more experienced surgeons that they may be able to work around it all depending on the individual's situation.

I would suggest talking with some of the very experienced surgeons to see what they say. Some of the surgeons with 1000's of procedures have likely dealt with similar situation to yours and can give you a feel for what they have experienced.

If you can't do da Vinci and want to go the open route, there are many guys on the forum that are quite pleased with the results of their open procedure.";"Age 49, healthy, physically very active

I did some literature search for you and they essentially supported what mtsarpilot said in his post. Let me try to summarize in plain English (medical journals sometimes read like Greek ) issues that are relevant to your case:

1. Surgeons are not risk takers. Their first priority to you is to ""do no harm"", so, anything that potentially can cause complications will make them think twice.

2. What are the major risks of laparoscopic surgery? The most relevant in your case is from ""trocar"" injuries. Trocar is the instrument they use to ""punch"" the initial hole through the abdominal wall to insert other instrument and to prepare you for surgery. The initial insertion is blind and could injure a blood vessel, the intestine or bowel. The risk is higher if the patient is too thin or had prior abdominal surgery.

3. Other risks like those with heart condition; pulmonary condition, CO2 complications, etc. are not relevant so I am not going to discuss those.

4. Why is prior abdominal surgery a risk? Well, after surgery, there could be what mtsarpilot called adhesion, sometimes called intra abdominal adhesion. After any operation, â€œadhesionâ€ or bands of scar tissue that binds 2 parts of your tissue together that are normally separated occur. This increases the likelihood of injury to organs during entry into the abdomen because organs ordinarily are not adherent to the abdominal wall, become fixed in one location and make them more prone to injury. It may be necessary to enter the abdomen at an alternate site to avoid entry complications.

5. So, if you have one laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon will try entry from the other side of the abdomen. And if you already have surgery on the other side, well, it might be difficult for him to find another safe entry. I think that is why your surgeon is hesitant.

6. Some very skill surgeons might be willing to attempt and convert to open if he encounters complications.

I don' claim to be correct, so you need to clarify with your surgeon.

Hope this helps and take care.";"";"newporter";"http://www.cancerforums.net/members/21257-newporter";"";"Top User";"Feb 2012";"Not Found";"5"

"10-01-2016";" 07:22 PM";"Had posted earlier about development of much pain that seemed to get worse beginning at week 5. At week 6, saw my surgeon who said the problem lie with the rejoining of the urethra to the bladder. My rejoining developed a problem for reasons unknown. He said to take it easy, and it should get better on its own. Well it did not, and after struggling with the burning pain for 2 weeks, I met again with my surgeon yesterday. He put me back on a Foley catheter for 2 weeks, and said things should heal. Two of the physician's assistants said that my problem just sometimes happens, and weren't surprised that I was still encountering the problem 8 weeks post surgery. They had treated a number of patients with the same problem. Both assistants said I will fully recover with some time to heal.

The doc did another cystocopy on me before inserting the catheter. From having my first cystocopy two weeks prior, I was not looking forward to the procedure again with pain level 7 intensity. That was torture. This time on my own, I took 2 codeine based pain pills just prior to going to his office to curb the pain. I was glad I did, as pain level intensity dropped to a tolerable 4 level. It just seems to me that uro doctors don't have a great concern for patient pain for procedures done in their office.

All the severe crotch pain is gone, along with the burning pain upon urination. What a relief that is. This Foley catheter is somewhat different from the one installed at time of surgery. Just what the difference is, I am not sure, but it is really not noticeable 90% of the time. Just so much more comfortable using this catheter. I just have to watch how full the travel bag is during the day. I nearly over filled it. I make it a point to lube the penis tip several times during the day, so it does not get irritated as it did with the Foley installed at time of surgery. So far, so good.

Thanks for the words of encouragement. I appreciate that.";"";"rooster22";"http://www.cancerforums.net/members/119783-rooster22";"";"Experienced User";"Jun 2016";"indianapolis, in";"57"

"10-13-2016";" 04:32 PM";"Update.............met with my uro surgeon who did my Da Vinci. My pain problem has been diagnosed as problem with a suture used to reconnect the urethra to the bladder. Somehow, the suture rubs on tissue as I walk or move about. This causes irritation, which causes inflammation, which causes burning pain to erupt. My catheter was removed today after 13 days of usage. Glad to say good-bye to that medical devise. Only solution is to bear the pain, and with time things should get better. The only option is open surgery, which doc says that would leave me incontinent. Doc said I am the first patient he has had to develop this problem, though he has heard from other surgeons with patients who have had this problem. So surgery is not realistic as a way to fix the pain problem. I will just have to bite the bullet and endure the pain. He gave me a prescription for Celebrex, as well as Percocet. Still an ice pack for my crotch may be my best friend for a while. I am frustrated, but things bound to get better.";"";"rooster22";"http://www.cancerforums.net/members/119783-rooster22";"";"Experienced User";"Jun 2016";"indianapolis, in";"57"

Thanks Roblee for the info. I am surmising the suture joining urethra to bladder is a permanent suture, or else it would have dissolved after 10 weeks. Doc says give it more time to heal, which prolly means scar tissue will grow over the suture to complete the heal. My doc really doesn't want to spend the time to explain things in detail to me.

I am only 3 weeks out and have the whole package at the moment so can't offer you insights except that this is a pretty big operation and things take time. The recommendation is you should not get back into any heavy training routine untill the 6 week mark, if this is the case for you then it has been only 2 weeks so be gentle with yourself.

If you started earlier then potentially you are delaying your recovery, it is not like sit up where the more you do the better.

If it helps I am a gym nut and been doing it for 25 years, I have now stopped everything except walking and feel as you do ( except shortness of breath). Just as an aside it may be worth going back and having your lungs tested, if your recovery has not regained your lung capacity it may well be you are not getting enough oxygen through your system wich affects all those symptoms you have outlined";"";"Bob_R";"http://www.cancerforums.net/members/105495-Bob_R";"";"Senior User";"Oct 2013";"Washington, DC";"5"

I never really experienced tiredness and certainly not shortness of breath, hopefully you have told your doctor about these issues. Two months is quite optimistic to expect an erection, at your age 6-9 months would be more realistic I think. If you get the green light from your doctor re your shortness of breath then tell him you plan to push yourself and do more exercise every day, even if it's only a little more.

The leakage should dry up as time goes on, as long as the surgery went well. Sounds like you are actually making a very good recovery.

Getting an erection is something that follows its own timetable from patient to patient. For some it's only a matter of weeks while, for others, it can be a couple of years.

But as long as you had nerve sparing surgery, you should eventually begin having erections ""almost"" as strong as however they were before the surgery. They often do not come back quite as strong, but will hopefully be easily hard enough to get the job done.

Please feel free to ask any other questions you might have.

In the meantime, just keep getting stronger & stronger.

Be sure to be religious about doing daily Kegel exercises. Also, if possible, hold urine in your bladder for as long as reasonably possible.

As mentioned above, I would lean toward stocking up now on pads and some shields (for later). Everyone is different with respect to the length of time you will need them, but here's a good reason to buy a lot now and trash the rest that are unneeded.

As I put the Depends on the conveyor belt at checkout, the woman in line behind me gave me a sympathetic look.

The heavy ones will hold a bladder full with no leaks. They fit in a pocket. You can snatch them out and replace them with your pants on. It seems a lot of guys are dry laying down from day one, including me, now getting vertical and to the head is a challenge.... One package of the heavy and 2 of the moderate pads got me through. 210 total. I still have a 1/2 pack left.

Watch the catheter. The nurse caught mine and gave it a yank getting into the car. A week later the PA pull the shelf out on the examining bench snagging it, pulling it out a bit. I was really amazed how easily the Dr pulled it out. Your urethra was cut in two and reattached to the bladder (yikes). No lifting, straining, bar stools or bicycles.


They sent me home with its straps taped to my leg. One day 3 the wife picked up a garter at a med supply, it was a big improvement. How it lasted a week I don't know.
Make sure you have sweat or warm up pants handy. The baggy light poly ones are best.

Get off the narcotics sooner than later, they cause constipation. I was on Tylenol at day 3. No straining, even down there, keep popping the Colace or similar stool softener they will give you.

I wouldn't necessarily jump to the conclusion that the urologist is being money-hungry.

"10-03-2016";" 01:14 AM";"#1: I recently had my primary care doc take over with my PSA tests as Dr. Carter told me he didn't think I needed follow up at this time. nor did we have to have our 'phone conferences' anymore as he felt I was doing well--unless I have concerns. I've been leery of this moment due to concern over the 'same lab' issue, but the drive into Baltimore to have Hopkins do the blood draw was a royal PITA at times. I came back at <.02, so I'm obviously relieved. I didn't ask, but do you guys know what testing method would've been used to get this number? I think if it was an uPSA it would have 3 number places right, or am I wrong? I believe the lab used was Solstas, which I also believe Quest is acquiring.

#2: A long lost 2nd cousin of mine contacted me a couple of months ago regarding her 68 year old husband's recently diagnosed PC. We've been talking, and he just went through RALP in August at Mercy Hospital in Baltimore (he worked there and was comfy with some of the docs, otherwise I was suggesting Johns Hopkins). He's recovered well, but apparently the path report found 'microscopic cells' at a margin. His PSA at 3 weeks post-op was .09, which is too early to really tell IMO (maybe the doc wanted a 'nadir' baseline) and he will get another PSA this upcoming week. The doc said he couldn't even see the margin cells under the magnification, and he was surprised by the report but still seemed confident of a good outcome. Path Gleason was 3+4=7.

But, what I really wanted to ask was this: He had NO lymph nodes removed. Is this even normal anymore? I'm sure that's sitting in the backs of their minds, knowing PC was found at the margin, and no lymph nodes were dissected, has to be making them uncomfortable. Their doc said, based on the pre-surgery info, he didn't feel removal of lymph nodes was necessary, but I had 11 removed, and I didn't seem to be at risk of anything out of the capsule (after imaging) pre-surgery either. They hadn't even thought of anything beyond the surgery as they were relying on the confidence of their doc, and now he's mentioning potential radiation. I sure wish they would've gone to Hopkins, about 15 minutes away from this hospital.....

Thanks guys. The lymph node thing has me thinking.....

My original pathology was Gleason 7 and the second opinion downgraded it to Gleason 6. They had the nurse call to give me the results and she told me the that because it was a 6 they wouldn't have to remove any lymph nodes. I questioned it and they said they don't like to do it if it's not 'necessary' because it increases the risk of other complications. In the end my surgery ended up taking four hours and they removed 14 lymph nodes. I'm thinking they must make judgement calls during surgery. I'm not sure if they do on-the-fly pathology or if it's just visual inspections. Even though my surgery is behind me I still have many new questions almost daily.";"DOB: 1969

1) ""The Same Lab Same Assay"" that I so frequently rant & chant about only applies to those who are in an elevated risk for recurrence category and must monitor their PSA to detect a rise. You simply are not in an elevated risk category. Congrats on the <0.02!!! I do suggest that one keeps copies of the actual lab report for future reference if needed.

2) Not sure why your relative had a PSA drawn at 3 weeks post op. Guessing that his Uro MD will repeat the PSA in another 3 - 6 weeks to compare the result and hope that is has decreased further.

3) I believe that Lymph node removal is the standard for RP. There is an old RP surgical approach = ""through the back door"" in which they have to take down the coccyx to get to the prostate. It yields good exposure but there is no access to the Lymph nodes. Possibly this was the case.

Glad you are doing so well!

Although your pathology was downgraded post-op, you made the choice that I, or almost all patients would have made given your original reports. Absolutely cannot second-guess what you did...it was totally appropriate.

Now, we get into the supplemental tests that COULD have been done before surgery. Yeah, those may have impacted your decision if they appeared less aggressive. But, what's done is done, and your cancer was treated. Let me assure you that I would have done the same if presented with the reports that you were.";"DOB: May 1944

Five biopsies from 2009 to 2014. The third and fourth biopsies were positive with one core and three cores <5% and G 3+3. Fifth biopsy was negative.
OncotypeDX: 86 percent chance of PCa remaining indolent
August 2015: tests are stable; no MRI or biopsy this year for my AS program
August 2016: MRI unchanged from 2/2014; PSA=3.9; FPSA=26; PHI=28. No biopsy necessary.

A NOTE ON PSA: My readings have been erratic for over 10 years; typically being 3.5-4.2, but spiking to over 10 at times.
These spikes are asymtomatic to me, and resolve themselves. A prostate biopsy can triple the PSA, which lasts for months.
Last Free PSA was 26. I don't worry about PSA spikes anymore.";"ASAdvocate";"http://www.cancerforums.net/members/113924-ASAdvocate";"";"Senior User";"Jun 2010";"Denver";"1,621"

A bit of an update as my cousin told me today that her husband's 2nd PSA came in at <.02, at I believe about 6 weeks post op, so there's at least some relief for now. I'll pass on what you've all told me to her. And PDV, interesting regarding what your uro told you regarding your own PM. Maybe that will cheer my folks up to know that.

Thanks ASAdvocate. I really appreciate the support. I really didn't know a whole lot about this subject prior to the biopsy. Hanging around here and reading the Dr. Walsh book has helped though. We could have definitely done some things differently up front but my biopsy turned out to be pretty consistent with the final pathology so it all worked out. I'm satisfied with my treatment but I still want to learn as much as I can so I can help others. I learn something new here every day thanks to all of you guys!";"DOB: 1969
